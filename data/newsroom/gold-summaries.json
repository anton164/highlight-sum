      "source": "Nobody wants to spend a lot of time and energy -- and taxpayer money -- and end up where they started. But that's what could happen with one of the principal elements of health reform, the \"exchange\" or \"gateway.\"\n\nLegislators are designing this new insurance marketplace to protect consumers from many of the pitfalls and inequities in the current system. But even as they focus on the details of how the marketplace will work, senators have indicated that they would allow insurers to continue operating outside it, much as the health-insurance lobby has sought.\n\nOne Senate bill would preserve the possibility that insurers could tailor policies to draw healthy individuals out of the new markets, leaving coverage less affordable for those who stay behind.\n\n\"It's a leak in the system,\" said Karen L. Pollitz, a professor at Georgetown's Health Policy Institute. \"It returns you to problems that we have today.\"\n\nSenate bills guarantee that certain basic reforms -- such as requiring insurers to accept people regardless of preexisting medical conditions and banning annual and lifetime limits on coverage -- would apply both inside and outside the new markets for individuals and small businesses. But that would not be true for a host of other requirements intended to help consumers compare health plans on an apples-to-apples basis and force insurers to compete more directly on price.\n\nFor example, the bill written by the Senate health committee would not require insurers operating outside the marketplace to provide standardized disclosures about what they cover.\n\nIt would not prohibit health plans outside the exchanges from using marketing practices that discourage the seriously ill from enrolling, nor would it demand that they offer \"a wide choice\" of medical providers -- including \"essential community providers . . . that serve predominantly low income, medically-underserved individuals,\" as the bill prescribes for insurers inside the exchanges.\n\nPerhaps the sharpest dichotomy is that, under the health committee's proposal, certain standards governing the nature and extent of covered benefits would apply only to policies sold inside the exchanges.\n\nAll of those factors contribute to the possibility that insurers might offer cheaper, less comprehensive policies outside the exchanges and entice healthier people to leave the new markets. That would leave the exchanges responsible for sicker people who are more expensive to insure.\n\nSimilarly, outside the exchange, the bill drafted by the Senate Finance Committee would not regulate the marketing of individual coverage, nor would it require that health plans be rated based on quality and price.\n\nThe legislation is now in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who is merging the work of the finance and health committees into a single proposal that could be unveiled as early as next week.\n\nUnlike the Senate bills, the one approved last weekend by the House says that all new policies for individuals would have to be sold within an exchange.\n\nThe Senate health committee would give plans operating outside the exchanges another break: Only those inside an exchange would have to pay a surcharge -- as much as 4 percent of premiums -- to defray the exchange's overhead costs. That could allow outside plans to undersell inside plans. In a written response to questions, the committee's Democratic staff said it would not work out that way because plans inside the exchanges would have to spend less on marketing.\n\nWhy would the health committee create an elaborate system of consumer protections and then allow insurers to operate outside it?\n\n\"Some people may not want to purchase insurance through a gateway. The bill is about creating and enhancing choice,\" the committee's Democratic staff said.\n\nThe main lobbying group for the health-insurance industry struck a similar theme in a July letter. Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, wrote that offering plans to individuals outside the exchange would \"improve choices for individuals and employers.\"\n\nIn seeking to create a more standardized marketplace, lawmakers were taking aim at a fundamental problem: It is hard for individuals to comparison shop for health insurance, because policies contain myriad, complex variables. Many people fail to spot gaps in their policies until they become severely ill, Nancy Metcalf, an editor at Consumer Reports, said in June testimony to a Senate panel. Insurance companies \"know exactly how to design and market plans whose gaping holes don't become apparent until it's much, much too late,\" Metcalf said.\n\nThe health committee bill would cut through some of the confusion by offering three tiers of coverage within exchanges. Plans competing within each tier would be required to have the same actuarial value, meaning that overall they cover the same percentage of anticipated expenses.\n\nBut under the health committee bill, insurance policies offered outside the exchanges would not have to conform to the three tiers, leaving consumers with the challenge of having to make apples-to-oranges comparisons.\n\nThe secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to establish an \"essential health benefits\" package, but it would not be essential that policies outside the exchange include those benefits.\n\nOutside the exchanges, people could buy policies that do not provide the basic coverage required to satisfy the terms of the individual mandate (the requirement that everyone have insurance coverage), thus exposing themselves to penalties.\n\nEven within the exchanges, there could be limits to consumer protections. The health committee bill would not explicitly guarantee consumers the right to an external appeal when a health plan refuses to pay for medical services. The right to an external appeal is a hallmark of the health-benefits program for federal employees, which has served as a model for the proposed exchanges."

      "source": "The Democratic party was run over in the midterm elections, giving up at least eight seats in the Senate. In some cases, they lost races they were supposed to win, and in others they lost by wide margins in contests that were supposed to be close.\n\nSo what does this newly chastened and humbled party do to show a fresh face to voters? It chooses the same person to helm the party as minority leader, naturally.\n\nSen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was re-elected to the top spot in his party's caucus on Thursday, but not without at least six votes against him and some pretty vocal opposition by his colleagues. Even some who supported Reid didn't exactly sound a note of confidence. As Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told Politico: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anyone else running.\u201d\n\nReid, apparently aware things can't just stay the same after the midterm lashing, is making some changes. \"We\u2019re going to do things a little differently, a little different approach,\u201d he told the Post as he left the Old Senate Chamber on Thursday night. In an attempt to expand and bolster his leadership team, he created an entirely new post for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the popular progressive voice, and appointed Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) to chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Tester's 2012 victory was seen as a blueprint for Democrats who hail from conservative states.\n\nReports say Reid will also open up weekly leadership meetings and policy lunches, and that he intends to let more Democrats take the wheel on specific issues, as well as to free up the process for amendments.\n\nBut will all this be enough? Warren's role, at least for now, seems ill-defined, and apparently came as a surprise to many Senate Democrats. And while more open meetings and lunches within the caucus should help, they won't correct the uneasy relationship between Reid and now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that has left so many senators feeling like bit players in a dysfunctional system. The relationship between the two men has broken down so much, the Post's Paul Kane wrote in July, it has \"almost immobilized the Senate.\"\n\nAnd so, here we are. A decisive midterm election is now over, and the same two men are still in charge, only with their roles reversed. It will be tempting for McConnell, who has reached the goal of becoming majority leader, to turn the tables on his longtime opponent. And Reid will need to adjust to his new role without a loser's spite. Given the battles between the two men, which have been described as akin to \"divorce proceedings between a couple who loathe each other,\" that won't be easy.\n\nPerhaps Reid's experience at the helm \u2014 and how well he knows the way McConnell works \u2014 will pay off. And the midterm losses may have been as much about President Obama as they were about a dysfunctional Congress. But until Reid and McConnell can find a way to bridge their divide, the Democratic party is going to have a hard time putting a fresh face on what for now continues to look like a lot more of the same.\n\nMore than 100 women in Congress for the first time, but not much growth\n\nLike On Leadership?

No director was attached and the script, based on the late 1970s sting operation that paired con artists with the Federal Bureau of Investigation known as Abscam, was incomplete and heavily procedural.\n\nTo create a commercially marketable feature, the studio hired director David O. Russell in early 2012, prior to the debut of his Oscar winning \"Silver Linings Playbook.\"\n\nMr. Russell deeply reworked the story, creating a 170-page shooting script that centered on a cast of characters versed in \"the art of survival and reinvention that was very [much] less about the plotting of the con and more about the people,\" said Richard Suckle, a producer on the film who also helped Mr. Singer secure the life rights of Mel Weinberg, a real life con man for whom the main character, played by Christian Bale, is loosely based.\n\n\"The fact that it was a hard story to tell and to pull off that degree of difficulty, we wanted to be smart about managing exposure and risk,\" said president of Columbia Pictures Doug Belgrad, who oversaw the development of \"American Hustle\" and helped hire Mr. Russell.

Ms. Ellison's international sales arm, Panorama Media, secured approximately $30 million in international presales at the 2012 Cannes International Film Festival, more than enough to begin principal photography.\n\n\"American Hustle\" takes place in 1978 New York and stars Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Robert De Niro. The film was shot over 42 days, primarily in and around Boston, with two days in New York.\n\nTo emphasize the dramatic nature of the film and avoid the possibility of falling into parody, Mr. Russell and Judy Becker, the film's production designer, agreed to avoid all the period clich\u00e9s as the script was being finalized: \"American Hustle\" would have no lava lamps, the color avocado was forbidden, as were black velvet paintings, and none of the film's characters would own any recognizable designer furniture of the period.\n\n\" 'Mad Men' has pretty much covered that,\" said Ms. Becker, who has served as the production designer on Mr. Russell's last two films. \"We didn't want to be part of their world.\"\n\nThe film does however tap into the widespread popularity of fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg's wrap dress, which according to the company had sold a million units by 1976.\n\n\"David is a filmmaker with a particular vision and style and we were going down the road with him, that was the bet we made,\" said Mr. Belgrad.\n\nSony executives are hoping that Mr. Russell's period drama will resonate with audiences familiar with the period. For those too young to remember, the studio is looking to its stars in their promotional efforts, in particular Ms. Lawrence, who has a following among young adults due to her high-profile role in \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy.\n\n\"American Hustle\" opens wide on 2,300 screens Friday. A handful of theaters in New York and Los Angeles have already screened the film, where it opened to $690,000. At $115,000 per theater average, it marks the highest opening for any live action movie in 2013.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Cheney at alexandra.cheney@wsj.com"

But as US filmgoers sit down to view Abdellatif Kechiche's Blue is the Warmest Colour later this month, they may just spare a second or two to pity their counterparts in the mountainous rural state of Idaho, where the explicit French drama has effectively been banned.\n\nCarole Skinner, owner of the Flicks theatre in Boise, said the cinema was unable to show the film because its alcohol licence prohibits the screening of movies which feature \"acts or simulated acts of sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law\" and \"any person being touched, caressed or fondled on the breast, buttocks, anus or genitals\". Blue is the Warmest Colour, suffice to say, includes pretty much all of the above.\n\nWorse still, the Flicks theatre is the only cinema in Idaho which shows European and arthouse fare. \"It isn't because we're prudes,\" an apologetic Skinner told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThere was better news for Kechiche and his stars Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos in their native France, where Blue is the Warmest Colour opened at the weekend. The film is currently riding high in second place at the box office, and picked up the biggest debut of the year for a homegrown movie. The successful bow is a partial vindication for the film's distributors, who opted for a 9 October release date at the expense of disqualification for next year's Oscar for best foreign language film. It also suggests that the row over Kechiche's controversial working methods has only boosted interest in the movie.\n\nExarchopoulos and Seydoux complained during the Toronto film festival that they had been put through a gruelling 10-day shoot for the 10-minute love scene at the centre of the film and were forced into a continuous one-hour take - during which the director refused to allow his stars to simulate blows - for a separate fight scene. Kechiche later lamented that his stars' comments would make it impossible for audiences to view the offending scenes \"with a clean heart and a watchful eye\" and mournfully called for the film's release to be cancelled. He said: \"In advance, they will ask: 'Did this man not harass the girls? Did they not cherish [the experience], too, and they do not dare say it?\"\n\nAt least Idahoan arthouse lovers can cross state lines to catch Blue is the Warmest Colour later this month. UK cinemagoers will have to wait until 15 November to view the Cannes prize-winner. A pair of screenings at the London film festival are already sold out.\n\n\u2022 Blue is the Warmest Colour: watch a clip of the Cannes Palme d'Or winner"

According to witnesses, Brown was shot without threatening the officer in any way; in the police account, Brown struggled with an officer over his weapon and in his car.\n\nInvestigators at the county police department, which took over the investigation from the small borough within a day of the incident, said on Wednesday morning that they have not yet interviewed a key firsthand witness, Dorian Johnson. He is a friend of Brown\u2019s and says he was walking with him when they were approached by police that evening.\n\nJohnson has told reporters an account in stark contrast to the police description of the shooting. Johnson says a Ferguson police officer approached him and Brown when they were just blocks from home, ordering them both to get off the street, and shooting Brown when he came forward with his hands up in the air.\n\nCounty Police Sgt.

      "source": "The Army psychiatrist suspected of being the lone gunman in a horrific massacre at Fort Hood in Texas took a \"very calm and measured approach\" to carrying out the mass shooting, the commanding general said Friday.\n\nSurvivors of the rampage that killed 13 and wounded 30 said the suspect, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, shouted \"Allahu Akbar!\" \u2014 \"God is great!\" in Arabic \u2014 before opening fire, base commander Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said.\n\nCone said officials had not yet confirmed that Hasan, 39, made the comment. Authorities searched his apartment early Friday for clues but haven't yet been able to talk to Hasan, who survived the shootings and was hospitalized on a ventilator.\n\nFederal authorities seized Hasan's computer Friday. It was not immediately known if FBI agents found anything suspicious on Hasan's computer files.\n\nA military official said investigators also are sifting through materials Hasan carried with him during the shooting incident and evidence left in his vehicle, which was found parked at the base.\n\nMilitary officials were piecing together what pushed a man who helped troubled soldiers to turn on his comrades. The Army wouldn't discuss a motive in an early-morning press conference, but initial reports suggested he feared his imminent deployment to Afghanistan and had been critical of the wars there and in Iraq.\n\n\"He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,\u201d Hasan's cousin Nader Hasan told The New York Times. \u201cHe had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there.\u201d\n\nSLIDESHOW: Deadly rampage at Fort Hood Army Base\n\nFederal law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that Hasan had come to their attention at least six months ago because of Internet postings that discussed suicide bombings. The officials said they are still trying to confirm that he was the author.\n\nOne of the Web postings that authorities reviewed is a blog that equates a suicide bomber to a soldier throwing himself on a grenade to save the lives of his comrades.\n\n\"To say that this soldier committed suicide is inappropriate. Its more appropriate to say he is a brave hero that sacrificed his life for a more noble cause,\" the Internet posting reads. \"Scholars have paralled (sic) this to suicide bombers whose intention, by sacrificing their lives, is to help save Muslims by killing enemy soldiers.\"\n\nHasan was working with soldiers at Darnall Army Medical Center on Fort Hood after being transferred in July from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he had worked for six years before recently receiving a poor review.\n\nCone said the shooter used two guns, including a semi-automatic weapon. He added there was no indication they were military weapons.\n\n\"We are trying to make sense of all this,\" the suspect's cousin told Fox News. \"He wasn't even someone who enjoyed going to the firing range.\"\n\nHasan was not known to be a threat or risk, Fort Hood officials said.\n\n\"We had no problems with job performance while he was working at Darnall,\" said Col. Steve Braverman, Fort Hood's hospital commander. When pressed, Braverman added, \"Not here. ... I'm not aware of any problems here.\"\n\nThursday's massacre was the worst mass killing ever to take place on a U.S. military base. A female civilian police officer identified as Kim Munley who shot Hasan was the one who stopped the spree. She survived, contrary to earlier reports that she had died.\n\nAn imam from a mosque Hasan regularly attended said Hasan, a lifelong Muslim, was a committed soldier, gave no sign of extremist beliefs and regularly wore his uniform at prayers.\n\nCone said witnesses spoke of the methodical way Hasan conducted the rampage. About 300 soldiers were lined up to get shots and eye-testing at a Soldier Readiness Center when gunfire erupted.\n\n\"It seems like a very high number of people for a single shooter,\" Cone told Fox News Friday. \"This is a very small area. ...In talking to the soldiers last night who were present, the shooter could move in very close distances and fire at very close range and hit a number of people. With the problem of ricochet fire, et cetera, he was able to injure that number of people.\"\n\nAll but two of the injured were still hospitalized, including Hasan, and all were in stable condition, Braverman told reporters.\n\nOne soldier who was shot said that he \"made the mistake of moving and I was shot again,\" Cone told CBS' \"The Early Show.\" Those present during the massacre \"would scramble to the ground and help each other out,\" he added.\n\nBraverman said at a news conference early Friday that Hasan was on deployment orders to Afghanistan. A military official later told The Associated Press that Hasan was to be deployed to Iraq. It was not immediately possible to verify the discrepancy.\n\nThe military official, who did not have authorization to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said Hasan had indicated he didn't want to go to Iraq but was willing to serve in Afghanistan.\n\nA neighbor at the apartment building near Fort Hood where Hasan lived said they had recently discussed his impending deployment to Afghanistan.\n\n\"He seemed OK with it,\" said Edgar Booker, a 58-year-old retired soldier who now works in a cafeteria on the post. \"I asked him how he felt about going over there, with their religion and everything, and he said, `It's going to be interesting.\"'\n\nHasan was unconscious in a hospital after being shot four times at the Army's sprawling Fort Hood post, officials said. In the early chaos after the shootings, authorities believed they had killed him, only to discover later that he had survived.\n\nA police source told FoxNews.com that Hasan's vital signs failed while he was being transported by ambulance to the hospital after the rampage but he was revived.\n\nFederal law-enforcement agents ordered an evacuation of the apartment complex where Hasan lived in Killeen, Texas, and conducted a search of his home, said Hilary Shine, director of public information for the city. She didn't say what was found during the search.\n\nBefore Thursday's shooting, Hasan reportedly gave away all of his furniture along with copies of the Koran to neighbors, KXXV-TV reported.\n\nAuthorities have not ruled out that Hasan was acting on behalf of some unidentified radical group, a senior U.S. official in Washington said. He would not say whether any evidence had come to light to support that theory.\n\nThe motive for the shooting remained a mystery, but Hasan was apparently set to deploy soon, and had expressed some anger about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said generals at Fort Hood told her that Hasan was about to deploy overseas.\n\nRetired Army Col. Terry Lee, who said he worked with Hasan, told Fox News that Hasan had hoped President Barack Obama would pull troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq. Hasan got into frequent arguments with others in the military who supported the wars, Lee said, and had tried hard to prevent his pending deployment.\n\nTwo other soldiers who were taken into custody for questioning were later released, Cone said.\n\nSoldiers rushed to treat their injured colleagues by ripping their uniforms into makeshift bandages. Officials have not ruled out the possibility that some casualties may have been victims of \"friendly fire,\" shot by authorities amid the mayhem and confusion at the scene, said a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that were under investigation.\n\nVideo from the scene showed police patrolling the area with handguns and rifles, ducking behind buildings for cover. Sirens could be heard wailing while a woman's voice on a public-address system urged people to take cover.\n\n\"I was confused and just shocked,\" said Spc. Jerry Richard, 27, who works at the center but was not on duty during the shooting. \"Overseas you are ready for it. But here you can't even defend yourself.\"\n\nSoldiers at Fort Hood don't carry weapons unless they are doing training exercises.\n\nThe shooting took place 1:30 p.m. Thursday at the Readiness Center, where soldiers undergo medical screening before being deployed or after returning from overseas.\n\n\"We have a terrible, tragic situation here,\" said Cone. \"Soldiers, family members and the civilians that work here are absolutely devastated.\"\n\nCone said the injuries \"vary significantly\" among the victims wounded in the shooting.\n\nThe shooter's cousin told Fox News that their family is in shock.\n\nHe said his cousin, who was born and raised in Virginia and graduated from Virginia Tech University, turned against the wars after hearing the stories of those who came back from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nNader Hasan said his cousin, who was raised a Muslim, wanted to go into the military against his parent's wishes \u2014 but was taunted by others after the terror attacks of Sept. 11.\n\nA former neighbor of Hasan's in Silver Spring, Md., told Fox News he lived there for two years with his brother and had the word \"Allah\" on the door.\n\nShe said the FBI interviewed her Thursday afternoon, adding she used to see a woman and a 3-year-old girl coming and going.\n\nAuthorities provided little information Thursday about the victims of the rampage at Fort Hood.\n\nGeorge Stratton's son, George Stratton III, was five feet away from the shooter at the Soldier Readiness Center and suffered a gunshot wound to his left shoulder.\n\n\"He said he was there doing medical stuff and all of a sudden someone came through the door, walked behind the desk and just started shooting,\" Stratton told FoxNews.com.\n\nHe said about 15 rounds went off and people started dropping to the floor.\n\n\"He peaked up over the desk and that's when he was shot in the shoulder, and he just went down again. He said he saw one of his NCOs get badly shot,\" Stratton told FoxNews.com after talking to his son in the hospital. \"After he got shot he told me, 'Dad, I got up, held my arm and took off running.'\"\n\nStratton said his son was expected to be deployed to Afghanistan in January after going to basic training exactly a year ago.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to believe something like this happened,\" Stratton told FoxNews.com. \"I think he's probably had his fill of war already.\"\n\nPresident Obama called the shooting a \"horrific outburst of violence\" on members of the nation's armed forces. \"It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on American soil,\" he said\n\nObama said his thoughts and prayers are with the wounded and families of the fallen.\n\nA spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said they don't know anything about Hasan, and condemned the shooting at Fort Hood.\n\nThe group issued a statement calling the shooting as a \"cowardly attack.\" They say no political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such violence.\n\nThe base and area schools were on lockdown after the mass shooting, and all those on the Army post were asked to gather for a head count, thought the lockdown was lifted Thursday night.\n\nCovering 339 square miles, Fort Hood is the largest active duty armored post in the United States. Home to about 52,000 troops as of earlier this year, the sprawling base is located halfway between Austin and Waco.\n\nFoxNews.com's Jana Winter, Catherine Donaldson-Evans, Michelle Maskaly and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "source": "MOSCOW, Feb. 3\u2014 A Soviet weekly newspaper today published the most detailed accounting of Stalin's victims yet presented to a mass audience here, indicating that about 20 million died in labor camps, forced collectivization, famine and executions.\n\nThe estimates, by the historian Roy Medvedev, were printed in the weekly tabloid Argumenti i Fakti, which has a circulation of more than 20 million.\n\nThe estimated number of deaths is about equal to the number of Soviet soldiers and civilians believed killed in World War II.\n\nMr. Medvedev's grim arithmetic was reported in a less detailed version last November in Moscow News, a limited-circulation weekly, which sells about 200,000 copies in Russian, but today's article marked the first time the numbers have been disclosed to a nationwide audience.\n\nIn all, Mr. Medvedev calculated about 40 million victims of Stalin's repressions, including those arrested, driven from their land or blacklisted.\n\nAlthough the bookkeeping of Stalin's terror is an inexact and contentious science, Mr. Medvedev's estimates are generally in line with Western calculations that have long been disparaged by more official Soviet historians.\n\n''It's important that they published it, although the numbers themselves are horrible,'' Mr. Medvedev said in an interview tonight. ''Those numbers include my father.''\n\nMr. Medvedev, a dissident Marxist who has recently been rescued from official obscurity and honored as a leading authority on dark corners of Soviet history, said the weekly newspaper solicited the article and presumably showed the contents to officials before publishing it.\n\nMr. Medvedev said he had no special access to official archives, but relied on his own compilations of material over the years and recent publications in the Soviet press.\n\nUnder a headline proclaiming ''The Number of Victims of Stalinism Is About 40 Million People,'' in a terse, question-and answer format, Mr. Medvedev cited the human cost of Stalin's leadership year by year, leaving it to the reader to complete the arithmetic.\n\nMr. Medevedev's accounting included these victims:\n\n* One million imprisoned or exiled from 1927 to 1929, falsely accused of being saboteurs or members of opposition parties.\n\n* Nine million to 11 million of the more prosperous peasants driven from their lands and another two million to three million arrested or exiled in the early 1930's campaign of forced farm collectivization. Many of these were believed to have been killed.\n\n* Six million to seven million killed in the punitive famine inflicted on peasants in 1932 and 1933.\n\n* One million exiled from Moscow and Leningrad in 1935 for belonging to families of former nobility, merchants, capitalists and officials.\n\n* About one million executed in the ''great terror'' of 1937-38, and another four million to six million sent to forced labor camps from which most, including Mr. Medvedev's father, did not return.\n\n* Two million to three million sent to camps for violating absurdly strict labor laws imposed in 1940.\n\n* At least 10 million to 12 million ''repressed'' in World War II, including millions of Soviet-Germans and other ethnic minorities forcibly relocated.\n\n* More than one million arrested on political grounds from 1946 to Stalin's death in 1953.\n\nThe Soviet press has left little unsaid about Stalin's shortcomings, probing into sacred myths like his conduct of World War II, likening him to Hitler, dissecting his cruelties period by period. But official historians have shied away from putting a number to it all..\n\nMr. Medvedev acknowledged in Argumenti i Fakti, and repeated tonight, that many periods of repression will never be fully measured because records have been lost or never existed."

[Clinton and Sanders] will fight this out next week and beyond.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Clinton did, in fact, win \u2013 by just 0.3 percent.\n\nSo while Clinton eked out a lead in the Iowa delegate count, the stunning size of that narrowest of margins means that she must dig in for a protracted \u2013 and expensive \u2013 primary fight.\n\nAs Jim Ver Steeg, a Democrat activist and PhD student in Rochester, New York, summed up Tuesday morning where the Democrats go from here: \"BREAKING: Bernie Sanders saw his shadow and predicted six more weeks of primaries.\"\n\nHildebrand adds that although Sanders has struck fear into many Clinton supporters, the Iowa win \u2013 narrow though it may be \u2013 should give her some momentum going into New Hampshire.\n\n\"I saw a lot of [Clinton supporters'] Facebook posts on caucus day asking, 'Are we going to have to relive 2008?' when Barack Obama and his grassroots movement came from behind to beat her,\" he says. \"There was a real possibility that Bernie Sanders could have done the same thing this time. The grassroots movement that was behind Bernie Sanders in Iowa was very, very similar to Obama's so the insider expectation was that Secretary Clinton would lose Iowa. Beating that expectation gives her some momentum.\"\n\n\"But she goes into New Hampshire, where she won eight years ago, now trailing Sanders by a lot there. She's got a lot to prove to see if she can gain support there and close that gap. Beating expectations in Iowa is going to help her with that in New Hampshire. But she's gotta figure out how to get into people's hearts. If she does that, I think she can do incredibly well.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Off the Record Strategies' Pfeifle skips right over Cruz and Trump and declares\n\nthe \"clear winner\" of the night: \"Young, vision, razor-sharp messaging and he came up from the pack and over-performed. He's the one that leaves Iowa with momentum.\"\n\nLuke Sharrett / Bloomberg via Getty\n\nTrump, who got his first real taste of loss Monday night, was hurt by his highly publicized\n\n, Pfeifle says. \"Chivalry was another big winner because the lesson from the Trump experience is: 'Don't pick a fight with a girl.' The thing with Megyn Kelly made him look small and I expect that hurt him with late-deciders.\"\n\n\"Trump had big rallies but no ground game and it just did not work,\" he added. \"You can pack up a civic center but it doesn't mean those people will show up and vote.\"\n\nCruz's Iowa pre-game was much more effective, Pfeifle argues. \"Ted Cruz showed that shoe leather still works in 2016. He went to all 99 counties. Pundits said it would be a waste of time but in the end it showed he cared about people and was willing to go anywhere to get their support.\"\n\nlost a lot of votes to Cruz and probably Rubio, Pfeifle says. \"You got to do your foreign policy studying. He never made the shift after the Paris attacks and San Bernardino attacks. He needed people to be able to see him as commander-in-chief and he never completed.\"\n\nIt didn't help that he left Iowa Monday night to pick up some \"fresh clothes\" from his home in Florida. \"Always pack a fresh set of clothes on the campaign trail or have them FedEx'ed,\" Preifle says. \"That's rule No. 1: Plan ahead, be prepared. Always have a fresh shirt ready to go.\"\n\nOther losers of the night were Rick Santorum, who has announced he's taking some time off to discuss next steps with his family (\"Iowa can't be a king-maker or queen-maker but it can end a campaign,\" Pfeifle says), and\n\n: \"The Bush campaign is trying to sell an Atari in an Apple Store world. Jeb has a great resume but he can't sell it in this environment.\"\n\nemerge from the Iowa fray, having sided with Trump after being courted by Cruz? She claimed victory on Facebook, writing: \"Tonight = America wins, the permanent political class does not, and that is good! \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Onward and upward, America!\"\n\nBut after the high-life on Trump's private 757, she was\n\nto Des Moines ahead of the caucuses. Time for an upgrade?"

Why do people need more shops?\u201d Caroline, in Bar Italia, is one of the many people who never went to Madame Jojo\u2019s, mourning the end of Madame Jojo\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s iconic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Bernie Katz, a Soho icon himself, the gatekeeper of the Groucho club. He corrected his tense. \u201cIt was a landmark. It\u2019s true, Soho is changing. It\u2019s faster, it\u2019s not as relaxed. But you just have to put your skates on and go with it.\u201d\n\nOpinion in this little grid of streets, and possibly in the world, divides squarely between neophiles and neophobes, optimists and pessimists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed at all,\u201d said Michelle Wade, proprietor of Maison Bertaux, London\u2019s oldest and most enchanting patisserie. \u201cIn so far as, it was always changing. When my uncle was a registrar at University College Hospital, they used to race down here to have a quick dance and a drink, in the Blitz. Then, of course, there was the Dylan Thomas, Lucien Freud era \u2026\u201d\n\nThese are two Sohos I feel suddenly mournful not to have experienced. \u201cWell,\u201d she said kindly, \u201ceveryone misses a train sometimes.\u201d\n\nCostas, 48, is honcho of the wonderful Arts Theatre Club, open six nights a week until three in the morning, but only (mainly) to chorus girls. \u201cThe people that work in theatre, they work really hard and they play really hard, and I don\u2019t think they make a lot of money, and they spend it all in here.\u201d\n\nIt is unlike any other bar you will ever go to, with a very real chance that people will start singing (properly) halfway through the night. \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, there will be no independents left in Soho,\u201d he said, laying that squarely with the two main landlords, Shaftesbury and Soho Estates. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically bought out Soho and are trying to get rid of all the little men. They prefer chains.\u201d\n\nBang opposite, literally and in viewpoint, is Martin Morales, the chef at Ceviche, a cracking little Peruvian restaurant that distils the new Soho, in which food is the new sex. There must be a cultural message in this somewhere, but I\u2019m not sure what it is.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s the centre of the universe. I am here all the time, I am here in the kitchen, I am walking the streets, looking at what is happening. I still see all the detail of the characters, people expressing themselves in unique ways. The exciting thing is chain restaurants and overly branded businesses tend to fail.\u201d\n\nEveryone, however, agrees on one thing: rents are ridiculous. It is frankly a miracle that Soho has stayed as distinctive as it has, given the amount a business would need to survive. And there\u2019s a general assumption that, whatever the details, this is what did for Madame Jojo\u2019s. How could you make a 21st-century profit from such a niche concern?\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d says Russell Norman, inventor of Polpo, Polpetto and Spontino, informal, Italian tapas joints, insisting Madame Jojo\u2019s closed down because of the bouncers\u2019 attack with baseball bats. \u201cIt was obviously a situation that needed a fair amount of scrutiny.\u201d\n\nHe rejects, too, the idea that there are two Sohos, the quirky, seedy, sex-club one, and the Big Landord, crazy rent, corporatised one. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that usually the bad guys are reckoned to be the landlords of Soho, people like Soho Estates. That was founded by Raymond, who established the sex clubs and gave it its gorgeous seediness.\u201d\n\nEven he admits that the rents are crazy: \u201cOur recent rent review on Beak street was breathtaking. But it\u2019s the way of the world. Landlords have to make money just like the rest of us, they have people to employ.\u201d I think Norman is the best thing to happen to London food since we discovered avocados, but this portrait of landlords as productive, job-generating people, just doing their best is \u2026 well, it\u2019s silly.\n\nI\u2019d only been in Madame Jojo\u2019s once myself, when my ex had a job as a stage manager. I thought it would be amusing to watch him scuttling around in a black polo neck picking up g-strings. It wasn\u2019t amusing at all.\n\nSince then, it had diversified \u2013 dabbled in entertainment with content besides nudity. It was, like its location, always too quirky to turn into a Spearmint Rhino. But the closure of one club, even that club, could never have sucked the oxygen out of this place. Soho\u2019s idiosyncrasy and transgression is more of an atmosphere than an act."

Team president Phil Jackson is going to need a handful of minimum-contract players to fill out the roster if he uses his more than $30 million worth of cap space on treasured pieces.\n\nThere\u2019s a remote possibility the Knicks will give Sanchez a look in late March if roster spots open up, as Andrea Bargnani, Pablo Prigioni and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire are no guarantees to stick.\n\nSanchez told The Post he wants to follow in Langston Galloway\u2019s footsteps. Both Sanchez and Galloway were on the Knicks\u2019 training camp roster, were cut and wound up in Westchester.\n\n\u201cLangston opened the door for everybody on my team,\u2019\u2019 Sanchez told The Post. \u201cHe\u2019s showing now that the guys here can play too and make it in the NBA.\u201d I think he changed everything with the Knicks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to see if they can call me up. I want to try to show them I can play in the league. My guy Langston did it. I\u2019ve been getting better from the first day.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Knicks look at Sanchez as a prospect, but money also is an issue regarding signing him for this season. That would mean his minimum contract would be $325,000 higher \u2014 from $525,000 to $845,000 for a second-year player.\n\nKnicks assistant general manager Allan Houston, who runs the Westchester Knicks, is the man behind Project Orlando.\n\n\u201cOrlando has a high skill level and surprising athleticism,\u2019\u2019 Houston told The Post. \u201cHe has been using this season as a learning experience to maintain the high level of energy on a consistent basis that\u2019s required on the NBA level.\u201d\n\nSanchez played in only one game during the Knicks\u2019 preseason, for 49 seconds in Syracuse. He thought he would get more playing time, but Travis Wear, who seems to have hit the rookie wall, made the roster.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it was really good for me,\u2019\u2019 Sanchez said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I had the opportunity even if I didn\u2019t play too much to be with an NBA team, just being able to practice and watch practice.\u2019\u2019\n\nGalloway said he thinks Sanchez is ready for an NBA roster.\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Galloway said. \u201c He\u2019s more versatile \u2014 able to play the 1, 2 and 3, able to bring the ball up and he\u2019s a willing passer, too. It makes him a real versatile player in any offense.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to a source, one Western Conference playoff team has interest in Sanchez, a free agent who can sign with any team.\n\nIn 22 minutes per game, Sanchez is averaging 9.0 points and 6.7 rebounds. At the D-League showcase in Santa Cruz, Calif., Sanchez scored a franchise-high 27 points with 12 rebounds.\n\n\u201cI feel I\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u2019\u2019 Sanchez said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s helping me. Allan Houston, assistant coach Michael Hodges, teaching me row to improve my shot and my game.\u2019\u2019\n\nSanchez grew up dirt-poor in the Dominican Republic before coming to the U.S. at age 20. He attended Monroe College in Westchester for two years before getting his big shot in Queens. Perhaps soon, Manhattan.\n\nKnicks rookie Cleanthony Early was sent to the D-League for Friday\u2019s and Saturday\u2019s games in Westchester against Sioux Falls. Early will return for the Knicks\u2019 Super Bowl Sunday game against the Lakers at the Garden, as coach Derek Fisher has found a tough time getting Early minutes.\n\nAccording to a source, Early hasn\u2019t fully regained his conditioning after knee surgery sidelined him for more than a month. Early didn\u2019t play in three of four games before playing 18 minutes against the Pacers on Thursday, mostly in garbage time."

He was set to hold a fundraiser later Friday in West Palm Beach, followed by a joint rally with running mate Mitt Romney in Daytona Beach. Biden, meanwhile, was holding events in Sun City Center and Fort Pierce.\n\nDuring his short tour of the technology center, Ryan met four student entrepreneurs who described for him the projects they were working on, according to a pool reporter. One entrepreneur gave him a sample bottle of her product, a type of liquid band-aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like New Skin,\u201d Ryan said as he examined the bottle.\n\n\u201cBut nicer,\u201d the woman replied.\n\nWhile touring the lab, Ryan also joked, \u201cThey make fun of me for drinking a lot of water\u201d \u2013 a reference to his debate performance last week, and the Saturday Night Live sketch that lampooned him for taking frequent sips from his glass during his face-off against Biden. Earlier Friday, during a radio interview with host Charlie Sykes, Ryan was asked about the sketch; he said he had seen it and had thought it was \u201chilarious.\u201d\n\nRyan then headed to the nearby University of South Florida Alumni Center for the entrepreneurship roundtable, during which he spoke for about 45 minutes with students and faculty members.\n\nAsked by one man about governmental research funding, Ryan responded: \u201cWe have to cut spending. ... That means you must prioritize. I\u2019ve always believed, and Mitt and I have talked about this as well, is basic research is something that\u2019s inherently governmental.\u201d\n\nAs he and Romney regularly do on the campaign trail, he advocated for less regulation and told attendees that \u201cthere is no substitute for growth.\u201d At one point, he noted that he was \u201cnot here trying to be political\u201d before going on to hail Romney for his ability to \u201cturn sluggish organizations into effective ones.\u201d\n\nShortly before wrapping up the event, he told one attendee that he expects there will be an \u201ceconomic renaissance very soon if we can get on top of our problems in a real structural way.\u201d\n\nThree hours after he arrived, Ryan took off for his next campaign stop in West Palm Beach, narrowly missing Biden, who departed Tampa about a half an hour before Ryan did."

But over the next decade, her health deteriorated until she was ultimately diagnosed with the brutal autoimmune disease. After getting her implants removed, McDonough says her health improved drastically and she ultimately became part of a class action suit against the implant makers.\n\nShe recounts her journey in 'Lessons From the Mountain: What I Learned from Erin Walton,' which was recently released in paperback.\u201d Fox411 spoke to the actress, who offered candid testimony on her struggles.\n\nFox411: Why did you decide to get breast implants?\n\nMary McDonough: I was trying to be successful as an actress and I kept hearing, 'Well they went blond and booby.' It was the 'Dallas' era, big hair, big boobs, so I thought in order to compete in the industry that I want to work in I had to fit in. All my friends were getting breast implants so I thought I should do it. Within 24 hours I broke out in a rash on my back.\n\nFox411: You believe your lupus was caused by the silicone.\n\nMM: Here's what I always say. There are people who are going to say I'm crazy and certainly Dow will tell you I'm nuts. Every plastic surgeon who keeps telling women on the internet that they're totally safe are not talking about the actual scientific studies that were done which were not completed that did talk about a link. The FDA's own scientists have their own studies which started to link auto-immune diseases to the implants. I was a very, very healthy girl. I got implants, I got sick. I had them for ten years. I got them out and I started to get better and I am in remission from lupus so you do the math.\n\nWe know that lupus can be chemically triggered. Implants bleed silicone gel, even if they're not ruptured. Mine were completely disintegrated.\n\nFox411: You were part of a class action suit.\n\nMM: I was. I got a little bit of money out of it. It was depleted because they (Dow) filed for Chapter 11. It was reimbursement for medical expenses, it was nothing compared to what I'd been through and continue to go through as a result.\n\nFox411: Your daughter has had many health issues which you think is linked to your implants.\n\nMM: The manufacturers are not doing the follow-up studies they promised the FDA they would do. The children have completely fallen through. All I know is she had bouts with vomiting all the time. She was born with low Apgar scores which can be normal. She has had different disabilities and problems with her health throughout her childhood. She still has stuff. We know from Dow's own studies that certain silicones cross placental barriers so even if you don't breast feed what happened to her? There's no implant to go in and remove from the kid so it's very scary.\n\nFox411: You're obviously very anti-implant.\n\nMM: It's the complete line of crap that surgeons are still selling people. If you have big boobs you'll feel better about yourself. Somehow a sac of silicone is going to heal your innermost troubles and your personal difficulties. I had to go inside and deal with the hole I was trying to fill that I filled with food, that I filled with silicone. I had to sit down with myself and go, 'What am I trying to do here?' It was a lot of soul searching, a lot of mistakes and yet I've come out the other side which I feel very blessed about.\n\nFox411: You write that while on 'The Waltons' you suffered from low self-esteem.\n\nMM: I didn't think I was ugly but they would whisper to me that I was the \"pretty one.\" It was not a comforting thing. It was something that was going to hurt other people's feelings. Also just this pressure, 'Oh since you're that, that is your only value,' and with that you have to be skinny, you have to wear makeup, this whole kind of BS image that was all of a sudden put on me and I didn't feel comfortable with it at all. It certainly was not how I felt.\n\nFox411: What did you call yourself?\n\nMM: I called myself hog body. I look at drawings from my diary back then and I'm just sad. The picture in the book shows what I really looked like and the drawing is how I felt but what I realized through being a life coach and doing work-shops on body image, it's all about identifying these myths or what people believe about themselves and other people. Like, 'she's a cheerleader, her life must be easy.' It's all about the emotional tattoos we put on ourselves and other people.\n\nFox411: You were encouraged to lose weight.\n\nMM: Oh yeah I was being injected with pregnant women's urine. I went to a doctor who gave me thyroid shots to stimulate the metabolism which instead completely shuts your thyroid down. It was insane. Pre-digested protein drinks that were pre-digested in a cow's stomach. It was disgusting. I did everything to try and fit into what I thought they wanted me to be.\n\nFox411: Your faith helped you work through your issues. You were raised a Catholic and you describe your spiritual journey.\n\nMM: I would describe myself as a spiritual Buddhist/Christian. Wayne Dyer is a real touchstone for me. I'm very much about embracing all religions and all people. It brought me to a place where God wasn't sitting on a throne constantly trying to punish me. I found my way to a more loving God.\n\nFox411: It seems like 'The Waltons' set was very happy.\n\nMM: It was. We had and still have some family dysfunction here and there, it was like a real family. But we are actually incredibly close. We see each other all the time. We're at each other's weddings, kids birthdays and unfortunately funerals at times. We've kind of weathered it all with each other which is really kind of unheard of. I don't know of any other show where people are actually as close as we are. There's a group of us that have dinner five times a year together and whenever I'm in New York I see Richard (John-Boy).\n\nFox411: It's still so popular.\n\nMM: It's on three different networks right now. People write to me every single day on my Facebook fan page. People wish that the world was still like that and they want to go back in time. The other thing is that they didn't have a family and the show represents family to them and now there's a second and third generation of people who are sharing the show because of the values and morals that are in the show. There was a sense of community, of people coming together to help each other during tough times and we're having such tough times right now.\n\nFox411: You ended up with no money after the show finished.\n\nMM: It is a classic story. It happens to 90 percent of kid actors. I started over. So when I worked as a waitress or bar tender people always said, 'Why are you doing this? You don't have to work again.'\n\nFox411: And you weren't paid very well.\n\nMM: The company we worked for was cheap. There were five adults who were making ok money and we were just the kids so we didn't make very much money. We get like eight cents an airing from cable."

      "source": "So. The Democrats are in freefall. Their \"landmark\" legislation -- ObamaCare, rammed through without a single Republican vote -- is in collapse. The president has been exposed as a liar (see: \"If you like your health plan, you can keep it. Period.\").\n\nHis poll numbers are tanking, from job approval to competency to trustworthiness to personal likability. The poll numbers for the Democrat Party are in the gutter as well, with the Republican Party now pulling ahead on the generic ballot.\n\nDemocrats are fleeing the scene of their own accident, refusing to be seen with the president and distancing themselves from the wreck that is ObamaCare.\n\nIn other words, the Democrats are on the run, vulnerable, weak, and poised for a major defeat.\n\nSo what are the Republicans doing? Are they going for the jugular, attacking nonstop until November and showing no mercy? (In other words, acting like Democrats...) Of course not. They're Republicans. They are stepping in to help the Dems out.\n\nInstead of pounding ObamaCare and the president and the Democrats with the facts of an atrocious stab at socialized medicine and the lies they've used to push it, the GOP appears ready to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by switching gears to the highly polarizing issue of immigration.\n\nNever mind that immigration doesn't even score more than 2 percent in polls asking what the most important issue is to the country. Rather than let this sleeping dog lie (at least through November), the Republican leadership is jumping to the assistance of the Democrats by supporting amnesty.\n\nRemember this CRITICAL POINT: For Obama and the left, no issue is about the stated issue. It's ALWAYS about something bigger and more profound \u2013 namely, as Obama put it in 2008, \"the fundamental transformation of the nation.\"\n\nSo, for the left, health care \"reform\" was never about health care or health insurance. It was only and always about using the huge health care sector (1/6th of the U.S. economy) as a lever to transform the broader economy into a European-style socialist model. For one simple reason: if the government controls your health care, the government controls you.\n\nObamaCare was never about your health care. It was about government power and control.\n\nAnd so it is with immigration \"reform.\" For Obama and the Left, it's not about actually dealing forcefully and effectively with the immigration issue.\n\nIf that were the case, the administration would be faithfully enforcing the laws we have on the books. It is not.\n\nThey seek this \"reform\" for one simple reason: because immigration is the final missing piece of the \"fundamental transformation of the nation.\"\n\nIf they can get amnesty for 12 million (who knows what the real number is? 12 million? 18 million? 30 million?) illegals, they know they\u2019ve got the country in a headlock. Most Hispanics are natural Democrat voters.\n\nNot all, obviously. Many believe in hard work, individual liberty, economic liberty, and obeying the law.\n\nBut the majority vote Democrat, and the party has been working hard to lock them into government dependency.\n\nIf amnesty goes through, the Democrats will flood the zone with millions of more Democrat voters, possibly flip Texas blue, and get their long-sought-after permanent Democrat voting majority.\n\nIf that happens, you will never again see a Ronald Reagan or a George W. Bush. You may never again see a GOP majority in Congress. The Republicans will be relegated to permanent minority status. And a shrinking one at that.\n\nThis is the goal of the Democrats. Why on earth would Republicans want to help them achieve it?\n\nBecause they think they'll be \"rewarded\" by Hispanic voters?\n\nThat didn't happen after the 1986 amnesty. In fact, the percentage of Hispanics voting GOP actually went DOWN after that amnesty.\n\nTo take the issue off the table? Forget it. As soon as the path to amnesty is in place, Democrats will accelerate the process to get them voting as fast as possible, so the \"issue\" will never be off the table for Republicans.\n\nObama and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and Organizing for Action and George Soros and Eva Longoria and everyone else on the extreme left must be laughing out loud at the pure, destructive stupidity of the Republicans. They've got the Democrats on the ropes, and they're throwing them a lifeline.\n\nWhile strangling themselves right out of existence.\n\nMonica Crowley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1998 as a political and international affairs analyst. She rejoined FNC as a contributor in 2008 after leaving in 2004."

      "source": "\u201cFlowers aren\u2019t just beautiful to show on tables,\u201d said Azuma Makoto, a 38-year-old artist based in Tokyo. His latest installation piece, if you could call it that, takes this statement to the extreme. Two botanical objects \u2014 \u201cShiki 1,\u201d a Japanese white pine bonsai suspended from a metal frame, and an untitled arrangement of orchids, hydrangeas, lilies and irises, among other blossoms \u2014 were launched into the stratosphere on Tuesday in Black Rock Desert outside Gerlach, Nevada, a site made famous for its hosting of the annual Burning Man festival. \u201dI wanted to see the movement and beauty of plants and flowers suspended in space,\u201d Makoto explained that morning.\n\nTo accomplish this mission, titled Exobiotanica, Makoto and his 10-person crew teamed with Sacramento-based JP Aerospace \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Other Space Program\u201d \u2014 a volunteer-based organization that constructs and sends vessels into orbit. JP\u2019s owner and founder, John Powell, started launching things into the upper atmosphere in 1977, when he was still a teenager. \u201cThe best thing about this project is that space is so foreign to most of us,\u201d says Powell, \u201cso seeing a familiar object like a bouquet of flowers flying above Earth domesticates space, and the idea of traveling into it.\u201d\n\nThe expedition started in the dead of night, at 2 a.m. One hour later, Makoto was already building a bouquet with about 30 varieties of flowers. He started with an aerial plant tied to a six-rod axis and studiously added peace lilies, poppy seed pods, dahlias, hydrangeas, orchids, bromeliads and a meaty burgundy heliconia. \u201cI am using brightly colored flowers from around the world so that they contrast against the darkness of space,\u201d he said. The scent of the flowers was stronger and more concentrated in the dry desert breeze than in their humid, natural environments, and the launch site was redolent with their perfume. Makoto worked quietly, until the metal rods were covered completely with plants. Then he directed his attention to his bonsai. For this particular project, Makoto chose a 50-year-old pine from his collection of more than 100 specimens, and flew it over from Tokyo in a special box. While readying it for space, he kept it moist and removed a few brown needles with a tweezer.\n\nUsing Styrofoam and a very light metal frame, Powell and his volunteers had created two devices to attach the bonsai and the flowers, which would launch separately. JP\u2019s volunteers and Makoto\u2019s team worked to calibrate still cameras, donated by Fuji Film for this project, and six Go Pro video cameras tied in a ball that would record the trip into the stratosphere and back in 360 degrees. There were two different tracking systems on each device, one a Spot GPS tracker that would help locate the vessel once it fell down back to Earth, and the other that recorded altitude and distance traveled from the launch site. A radio transmitted the data to a computer array in a van. While the crew waited, Makoto took a red carnation, drilled a hole in a crack of the arid, sandy soil and planted it there. It was his nod to the huge red sun that had started to come up. The Exobiotanica team posed for photos. None of them had ever seen a landscape like this.\n\nAt 6:30 a.m., the first helium balloon that would launch Away 101, as JP Aerospace named the device, was ready, and the frame with the dangling bonsai was carefully brought to the launch site. Once it was attached to the vessel, Powell and his volunteers went through a final checklist, a cord was pulled and a giant helium balloon emerged from underneath a tarp. An hour and a half later, the flower bouquet, or Away 100, was off too. Both devices had roughly the same flight path. Away 101 went to 91,800 feet, traveling up for 100 minutes until the helium balloon burst. It fell for 40 minutes; two parachutes in baskets opened automatically when there was enough air in the atmosphere to soften impact. Away 100, which held the arrangement, made it up to 87,000 feet. Both devices were retrieved about five miles from the launch site. The bonsai and flowers, though, were never found.\n\nAfter both pieces went up, Makoto embraced his team warmly and smiled. \u201cI always wanted to travel to space,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a dream come true.\u201d"

I did it because I believed it was good for the country. I did it because I believed it was good for the American people,\" Obama said Thursday.\n\nObama: Health care ruling a victory for all Americans\n\nBoth sides will now take their case to the American electorate heading into the fall election.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans who fought hard against the law's initial passage were not happy.\n\n\"The president of the United States himself, promised up and down that this bill was not a tax,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said from the Senate floor Thursday. \"This is one of the Democrats' top selling points because they knew it would not pass if it was a tax. Well, the Supreme Court has spoken -- this law is a tax. The bill was sold to the American people on a deception.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts clarified that point in the opinion: \"The Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. ... The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.\"\n\nHow the justices voted, what they wrote\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats in Congress were elated.\n\nA visibly relieved Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, applauded the decision from the Senate floor. Like Obama, the veteran lawmaker spent enormous political capital marshaling his caucus and pushing the law's passage.\n\n\"Passing the Affordable Care Act was the greatest single step in generations toward ensuring access to affordable, quality health care for every person in America regardless of where they live, how much they make,\" Reid said Thursday.\n\nThe key House leader who pushed through the bill in 2010 indicated the court's ruling was a vindication of months of work.\n\n\"In passing health reform, we made history for our nation and progress for the American people. We completed the unfinished business of our society and strengthened the character of our country,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who was House speaker until her party lost the majority in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\n\"We ensured health care would be a right for all, not a privilege for the few. Today, the Supreme Court affirmed our progress and protected that right, securing a future of health and economic security for the middle class and for every American.\"\n\niReport: Did the court make the right decision?\n\nRepublicans, clearly frustrated, attacked the ruling and the president.\n\n\"The proposed cure was made to be worse than the disease,\" McConnell said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia said he was \"disappointed\" in the decision and on his way into a closed door House GOP meeting on the ruling. He said the House will vote after it returns from July Fourth recess to repeal the health care law.\n\nStill, the ruling was a much-needed win for a president locked in a tough re-election campaign.\n\n\"It is a major part of the president's potential legacy,\" said Andrew Rudalevige, an associate political science professor at Dickinson College and author of \"The New Imperial Presidency: Renewing Presidential Power After Watergate.\" \"And the individual mandate does hold the substance of the package together, cost-wise and substantively.\"\n\nA major initiative for a new president\n\nWhen Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, the move heralded a major -- albeit hard-won -- political success for the president. The controversial legislation, which critics dubbed \"Obamacare,\" extended coverage to 30 million Americans and was the culmination of a drawn-out and deeply partisan fight about the role of government.\n\nFor Obama, the law's passage proved his administration's ability to push through its policy agenda despite strong oppositional headwinds.\n\nAs Vice President Joe Biden told Obama after the law passed: \"This is a big f---ing deal.\"\n\nBut netting that deal also cost the president tremendous political capital.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNPolitics. Join us on Facebook/CNNPolitics.\n\nDuring the August recess of 2009, angry conservatives stormed congressional town halls to protest the legislation.\n\nRepeal \"Obamacare\" became the rallying cry for a new wave of tea party-backed Republican House freshmen. Their massive sweep during the 2010 elections sent moderate Democrats packing and flipped control of the House of Representatives to the GOP.\n\nTimeline of the health care law\n\nWithin months of the law's passage, the controversial law was in the courts. Conflicting appellate rulings ultimately led to the case being sent to the U.S. Supreme Court. Twenty-six states also pressed the Supreme Court to examine the law.\n\nSince the law was modeled after a similar Massachusetts measure, as the state's former governor, Romney, will face heightened scrutiny from conservatives determined to hold him to his campaign promises to repeal the law.\n\n\"I don't think there's an upside for the president here,\" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and an expert on the Supreme Court. The ruling \"energizes Republicans and the tea party.\"\n\nRudalevige added, \"Romney will of course try to tie Obama back to the issue.\"\n\nAnd Romney will have support from the Republican National Committee, which launched the website \"PeopleVObamaCare.com\" after the court's decision.\n\nRomney press secretary Andrea Saul tweeted that in the hours following the ruling, the campaign had \"(j)ust crossed $1 million raised for @MittRomney since SCOTUS decision. \u202a#FullRepeal\u202c\" -- touting a hashtag set up for the decision.\n\nReflecting after the ruling, Pelosi recalled the longtime dream of Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime champion of health care reform who died in 2009, a year before the legislation's passage.\n\n\"I knew that when he left us he would go to heaven and help pass the bill,\" she said from Capitol Hill. \"And now he can rest in peace. His dream for America's families has become a reality.\"\n\nCourt ruling cements Obama's political legacy, experts say"

      "source": "A yellow-green gas settles in the street of a Syria village. A man wearing a gas mask rushes a woman with a cloth wrapped around her face to safety. Others scramble in confusion. Coughing can be heard in the background.\n\nThe scene comes from a new video posted online Friday by Syrian rebel activists, who say it reveals a recent chlorine gas attack on a pro-rebel village conducted by the forces of Syrian president Bashar Assad.\n\nThe video\u2019s authenticity is still unconfirmed. But top Obama administration officials are bracing for confirmation \u2014 in weeks or even days \u2014 that chemical warfare is underway again in Syria. And that means President Obama has a new crisis on his hands.\n\nFlash back to one of the most dramatic moments of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency: last September 10, when Obama delivered a prime-time national address to explain why he intended to order a military strike on Syria to punish the use of nerve gas against civilians in violation of the red line he had famously drawn for Assad.\n\n\u201cThis is not a world we should accept,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regime\u2019s ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use,\u201d Obama concluded.\n\nThere was no strike, of course. Obama, who never really wanted to use force, backed a Russian proposal to remove and destroy Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal. It was a short-term embarrassment \u2014 but one that Obama officials now call a success: Assad ceased his chemical attacks and declared his stockpile to international inspectors, who have since removed about 95% of it for destruction by the U.S.\n\nFor many Americans, Syria\u2019s chemical weapons count as a problem solved. But that\u2019s about to change.\n\nWhile it was sarin gas that crossed Obama\u2019s red line last summer, this time chlorine is the weapon of choice. Chlorine may be harmless in swimming pools, but it is lethal in concentrated form. Human Rights Watch says there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of multiple chlorine attacks in Syria last month, with clouds of yellow gas killing 11 people and sickening another 500 with symptoms that can include vomiting, splitting headaches and uncontrollable coughing. Syrian activists say another chlorine attack earlier this week killed a disabled teenager. France\u2019s foreign minister says Syrian forces may have used chlorine 14 times in recent months.\n\nAnd now the president who said he \u201cwill not tolerate\u201d the use of chemical weapons faces another challenge to his red line \u2014 one that will again test his credibility, and renew talk of U.S. military action in Syria.\n\nIt\u2019s true that chlorine is far less deadly than nerve gas. But it does kill, and has done so from the battlefields of World War I to Al-Qaeda attacks in Iraq. More to the point, its use is prohibited by the international Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syrian dictator Bashar Assad signed last fall to avert U.S.-led airstrikes. (Syria did not declare chlorine, which has numerous commercial and industrial uses, as part of its chemical arsenal for destruction.)\n\nWashington is still largely in denial about this dilemma. But it won\u2019t be long beore it becomes unavoidable. The trigger will be the results of an investigation underway in Syria by the Organisation to Prohibit Chemical Weapons. But its outcome is predictable. French and Israeli officials have already said they believe the reports, and last week Secretary of State John Kerry said he\u2019s seen \u201craw data\u201d to the same effect.\n\nAssad\u2019s brazen return to warfare by poison gas puts Obama in a miserable spot. The White House will have two main options. One is react with fury and revive the threat of air strikes. \u201cIt is clear to me,\u201d says James Jeffrey, a former Bush deputy national security advisor and Obama\u2019s first ambassador to Iraq, \u201cthat the only position Obama can take is to say that the U.S. takes this seriously as a violation of our red line, and if that if chlorine gas is used again by regime forces, \u2018I will use military force.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut those are words Obama badly wants to avoid. He surely has no interest in laying down a new chemical weapons \u201cred line,\u201d especially after his last one proved a political fiasco \u2014 and especially over chlorine, which is horrible if you inhale it but isn\u2019t morally or strategically to far more lethal sarin gas\n\nMore likely, the White House will craft a subtler response, one designed to avert a crisis atmosphere and sidestep new talk of military action. That would likely involve pointing to the progress made toward removing Assad\u2019s declared stockpiles (although that project is likely to miss its deadline, and questions are growing about whether Assad failed to declare some of his deadliest agents). And it would reflect a belief in some quarters of the administration that increased training, aid for and vetting of moderate rebel groups stands a growing chance of toppling Assad without the heavy hand of American air power.\n\nBut that approach comes with real costs, too. A low-key reaction on Obama\u2019s part might look timid. The president\u2019s critics would gleefully revisit their complaints that Obama\u2019s red lines lack credibility. (John McCain has said that proven chlorine use would \u201cviolate the spirit\u201d of the September deal to remove Syria\u2019s chemical arms, requiring that Assad\u2019s regime \u201cfinally be held accountable.\u201d) Nervous U.S. allies from the Middle East to Asia will hardly be reassured about America\u2019s toughness.\n\nNeither option is simple, or palatable. But nothing is when it comes to Syria\u2019s civil war, as President Obama already knows too well."

Apparently, not yet.\n\nOn Friday the government said consumers spent 3.2 percent more on an annual basis in the January-March quarter than in the previous quarter \u2014 the biggest jump in two years. And in a report Monday, the government said consumers increased their spending in each month, by 0.2 percent in March, 0.7 percent in February and 0.3 percent in January.\n\nUS loans from China at issue in debt-ceiling fight\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Despite what you may have heard, China isn't the country's biggest creditor. America is.\n\nThe bulk of the national debt \u2014 soon to exceed a staggering $17 trillion \u2014 is held by the Federal Reserve, Social Security system, various pension plans for civil service workers and military personnel, U.S. banks, mutual funds, private pension plans, insurance companies and individual domestic investors.\n\nChina is responsible for just a shade over 7 percent of that total debt. And while it remains the single largest foreign lender (just ahead of Japan), China's been slowly trimming its holdings, down from nearly 10 percent a few years ago. Overall, foreign investors \u2014 including national central banks \u2014 account for roughly a third of the total outstanding federal government debt.\n\nGoogle invades Siri's turf with iPhone, iPad app\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Siri may be feeling a little job insecurity. The sometimes droll assistant that answers questions and helps people manage their lives on Apple's iPhone and iPad is facing competition from an up-and-coming rival made by Google.\n\nThe duel began Monday with the release of a free iPhone and iPad app that features Google Now, a technology that performs many of the same functions as Siri.\n\nIt's the first time that Google Now has been available on smartphones and tablet computers that aren't running on the latest version of Google's Android software. The technology, which debuted nine months ago, is being included in an upgrade to Google's search application for iOS, the Apple Inc. software that powers the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. It's up to a user to decide to activate Google Now within the redesigned Google Search app, which is available through Apple's app store.\n\nHospitals fight superbugs with Germ-zapping 'robots'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 They sweep. They swab. They sterilize. And still the germs persist.\n\nIn U.S. hospitals, an estimated one in 20 patients pick up infections they didn't have when they arrived, some caused by dangerous \"superbugs\" that are hard to treat.\n\nThe rise of these germs, along with increased pressure from the government and insurers, is driving hospitals to try all sorts of new approaches to stop their spread \u2014 machines that resemble \"Star Wars\" robots and emit ultraviolet light or hydrogen peroxide vapors \u2014 germ-resistant copper bed rails, call buttons and IV poles, along with antimicrobial linens, curtains and wall paint.\n\nWhile these products can help get a room clean, their impact is still debatable. There is no widely accepted evidence that these innovations have prevented infections or deaths.\n\nPending US home sales reach 3-year high in March\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose in March to the highest level in three years, pointing to higher sales this spring.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors said Monday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 1.5 percent to 105.7. That's the highest since April 2010, when a homebuyer's tax credit boosted sales. It's also above February's reading of 104.1.\n\nThere is generally a one-to-two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale. Contract signings rose in the South, West and Midwest, and were unchanged in the Northeast.\n\nChrysler profit falls 65 percent on lower shipments\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Chrysler's first-quarter profit tumbled 65 percent as shipments of cars and trucks fell while it prepared factories to launch several key new vehicles.\n\nThe Auburn Hills, Mich., company said Monday that it earned $166 million in the January-March quarter, compared with $473 million a year ago. Revenue fell 6 percent to $15.4 billion.\n\nChrysler, which is majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA, said worldwide vehicle shipments fell 6 percent during the quarter to 574,000.\n\nExpress Scripts profit up 39 percent\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Express Scripts says its first-quarter earnings jumped 39 percent compared to last year, when charges tied to its acquisition of competitor Medco Health Solutions hurt the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager's performance.\n\nThe acquisition more than doubled Express Scripts' revenue in the quarter, more than offsetting higher operating costs for the combined company.\n\nExpress Scripts made $373 million, or 45 cents per share, in the quarter, up from $267.8 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, profit was 99 cents per share.\n\nJC Penney to get $1.75 billion in financing\n\nPLANO, Texas (AP) \u2014 J.C. Penney on Monday confirmed that Goldman Sachs will provide it with $1.75 billion in financing.\n\nThe five-year senior secured term loan can be used to fund the company's operations as well as pay off some of its debt. It will be secured by real estate, as well as an interest the company's other assets and some of its subsidiaries.\n\nJames Bond studio to open 1st US facility in Georgia\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The British film studio that's home to the James Bond movie franchise announced plans Monday for its first U.S. film production facility, at a site near Atlanta.\n\nThe large-scale film complex will be called Pinewood Atlanta, and Pinewood will manage the facility under an agreement with a group of private investors. Plans call for the studio to be developed on 288 acres south of Atlanta in Fayette County and initially include at least five soundstages as well as production offices.\n\nIt's the fifth major studio development or expansion announced in Georgia in recent months. Last week, Atlanta-based developer Jacoby Development said it would build an estimated $1 billion multi-use project north of Atlanta that will include 12 soundstages as well as production offices and an arts and media school aimed at training the next generation for the film industry.\n\nItaly's new government wins 1st confidence vote\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 Italy's new government easily passed its first confirmation vote Monday in parliament after Premier Enrico Letta made concessions to his uneasy coalition allies, promising to relax part of a slate of austerity measures that have weighed on Italians impatient at the slow pace of economic recovery.\n\nWhile pledging the country will do what the eurozone wants to improve its public finances and debt problem, the center-left leader has to placate his tense two-day-old coalition, including former premier Silvio Berlusconi's conservatives, whose support he needs for confirmation.\n\nThe lower house of Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, approved his fledgling government by a vote of 453 to 153. The government faces the second mandatory confidence vote of confirmation in the Senate on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 106.20 to 14,818.75, up 0.7 percent. The S&P 500 index rose 11.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1,593.61. The Nasdaq composite rose 27.76 points to 3,307.02, an increase of 0.9 percent.\n\nBenchmark crude for June delivery gained $1.50 to finish at $94.50 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil from the North Sea used by many U.S. refiners, rose 65 cents to end at $103.81 on the ICE Futures exchange in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline was up almost a cent to finish at $2.83 a gallon. Heating oil was flat at $2.90 a gallon. Natural gas added 17 cents to end at $4.39 per 1,000 cubic feet."

William Shatner, one of the stars of Star Trek and a favorite of Trekkies, is getting barbecued online for not going to Sunday's funeral for his co-star Leonard Nimoy. Now it's not just online criticism, try this: the New York Daily News dubbed him \"Captain Jerk.\"\n\nSo, why did Shatner say he could not make the funeral? Well, he promised the Red Cross he would go to their charity event in Florida, and obviously he could not be in two places at once. Shatner said his daughters would his representatives at Nimoy's funeral.\n\nBut then, after a lot more criticism blew up all over Twitter, Shatner did jump on a plane as soon as he could, and that was Sunday morning after the charity event. But then he got to LA too late for the funeral. The funeral was at 9:00 am and Shatner did not arrive in LA until 11:30am, so he missed it.\n\nSo here's my thought: For God's sake, quit dumping on Shatner. I'm sure he feels terrible that Nimoy died. Yes, while their relationship was rocky in their early Star Trek days, they later became close friends. In 2004,, Shatner posted this about Nimoy: \"He's my wonderful companion through time, and I value his presence in my life more than I can say.\n\nSo I don't know about you, but I'm more interested in how my friends treat me when I'm alive than who shows up at my funeral.

      "source": "By BRUCE ACKERMANSEPT. 11, 2014\n\nBERLIN \u2014 PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019s declaration of war against the terrorist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria marks a decisive break in the American constitutional tradition. Nothing attempted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, remotely compares in imperial hubris.\n\nMr. Bush gained explicit congressional consent for his invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In contrast, the Obama administration has not even published a legal opinion attempting to justify the president\u2019s assertion of unilateral war-making authority. This is because no serious opinion can be written.\n\nThis became clear when White House officials briefed reporters before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech to the nation on Wednesday evening. They said a war against ISIS was justified by Congress\u2019s authorization of force against Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and that no new approval was needed.\n\nBut the 2001 authorization for the use of military force does not apply here. That resolution \u2014 scaled back from what Mr. Bush initially wanted \u2014 extended only to nations and organizations that \u201cplanned, authorized, committed or aided\u201d the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMr. Obama is rightly proud of his success in killing Osama bin Laden in 2011 and dismantling the Qaeda network he built up. But it\u2019s preposterous to suggest that a congressional vote 13 years ago can be used to legalize new bombings in Syria and additional (noncombat) forces in Iraq. In justifying earlier bombing campaigns in Yemen and Somalia, the administration\u2019s lawyers claimed that the 2001 authorization covered terrorist groups that did not even exist back then. They said it sufficed to show that these groups were \u201caffiliated\u201d with Al Qaeda.\n\nEven this was a big stretch, and it is not big enough to encompass the war on ISIS. Not only was ISIS created long after 2001, but Al Qaeda publicly disavowed it earlier this year. It is Al Qaeda\u2019s competitor, not its affiliate.\n\nMr. Obama may rightly be frustrated by gridlock in Washington, but his assault on the rule of law is a devastating setback for our constitutional order. His refusal even to ask the Justice Department to provide a formal legal pretext for the war on ISIS is astonishing.\n\nSince ISIS poses a new problem for the president, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires him to seek a new mandate from Congress. The resolution, enacted over President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s veto at the end of the Vietnam War, requires the president to obtain congressional assent within 60 days of commencing \u201chostilities\u201d; if he fails, he must withdraw American forces within 30 days.\n\nThe administration gave Congress the requisite notice on Aug. 8 that it had begun bombing ISIS, and so the time for obtaining approval runs out on Oct. 7. But Mr. Obama and his lawyers haven\u2019t even mentioned the War Powers Resolution in announcing the new offensive against ISIS \u2014 there is no indication that he intends to comply with this deadline.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s defenders may point to the precedent set by Bill Clinton, who continued the NATO-led bombing of Kosovo in 1999 beyond the 60-day limit without congressional assent. But Mr. Clinton halted the campaign before the 30-day withdrawal period ended.\n\nIn 2011, when Mr. Obama continued to bomb Libya after the 60-day limit, his lawyers argued that America\u2019s supporting role in the NATO campaign was not substantial enough to quality as \u201chostilities\u201d under the 1973 resolution. This claim provoked howls in Congress and the legal community, but the death of the Libyan dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, took the steam out of the debate before it could be resolved.\n\nEven if the Obama line on Libya were accepted, however, it fails to justify his current move. Rather than \u201cleading from behind\u201d by backing NATO, Mr. Obama is now taking the lead in an open-ended campaign, extending from Iraq into Syria, that could last years. If this isn\u2019t commencing \u201chostilities,\u201d what is?\n\nSenators and representatives aren\u2019t eager to step up to the plate in October when, however they decide, their votes will alienate some constituents in November\u2019s midterm elections. They would prefer to let the president plunge ahead and blame him later if things go wrong. But this is precisely why the War Powers Resolution sets up its 60-day deadline: It rightly insists that unless Congress is willing to stand up and be counted, the war is not worth fighting in the name of the American people.\n\nIf Mr. Obama changes course, as he did last September, and submits to the commands of the War Powers Resolution, Congress can demonstrate that, despite all its dysfunction, it can still rise to the occasion. There are hawks and doves on both sides of the aisle, and leaders of both parties have signaled a willingness to engage in a serious debate.\n\nBut for now the president seems grimly determined to practice what Mr. Bush\u2019s lawyers only preached. He is acting on the proposition that the president, in his capacity as commander in chief, has unilateral authority to declare war.\n\nIn taking this step, Mr. Obama is not only betraying the electoral majorities who twice voted him into office on his promise to end Bush-era abuses of executive authority. He is also betraying the Constitution he swore to uphold.\n\nBruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale, is a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin.\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on September 12, 2014, on page A31 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama\u2019s Betrayal of the Constitution.

He was asked how his sixth Winter Games medal felt different than the rest. The resulting talk with NBC\u2019s Christin Cooper was as raw and emotional as an interview at a sporting event can get, as Miller talked about his younger brother Chilly, who died last year of an apparent seizure thought to be related to a brain injury from an old motorcycle accident. The camera zoomed in tight as Bode spoke.\n\nMiller: This was a little different. With my brother passing away, I really wanted to come back here and race the way he sends it. So this was a little different.\n\nCooper: Bode, you\u2019re showing so much emotion down here. What\u2019s going through your mind?\n\nMiller: (Long pause) A lot, obviously. A long struggle coming in here. And, uh, just a tough year.\n\nCooper: I know you wanted to be here with Chilly experiencing these games, how much does it mean to you to come up with a great performance for him? And was it for him?\n\nMiller: I mean, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s really for him. But I wanted to come here and uh \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I guess make my self proud. (Pauses, then wipes away tears.)\n\nCooper: When you\u2019re looking up in the sky at the start, we see you there and it just looks like you\u2019re talking to somebody. What\u2019s going on there?\n\nAfter that question, Miller fell to his knees and rested himself on a fence separating him from Cooper. The NBC interviewer could be heard whispering \u201csorry\u201d and gently put her hand on Miller\u2019s shoulder before he walked away a few seconds later.\n\nCooper was the subject of some criticism on Twitter for pressing with the interview after it was clear Miller was getting emotional. Though the chat could have stopped when Miller shed a tear after what would be his last words, it was Miller himself who initially brought up his brother and appeared interested in talking about him during the interview. When that proved too hard for Miller, Cooper backed off and offered her hand.\n\nLater, Miller sent a tweet in which all the words he couldn\u2019t say were summed up with one heartbreaking line.\n\nThanks for all the support, today was one of the most emotional days of my life. I miss my brother.\u2014 Bode Miller (@MillerBode) February 16, 2014\n\nAfter the uproar made the news, Miller asked that his fans be civil to Cooper and defended the questions asked of him.\n\nI appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w christin cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault. #heatofthemoment\u2014 Bode Miller (@MillerBode) February 17, 2014\n\nMy emotions were very raw, she asked the questions that every interviewer would have, pushing is part of it, she wasnt trying to cause pain.\u2014 Bode Miller (@MillerBode) February 17, 2014\n\nNBC released a statement Monday morning acknowledging the controversy, but defending its handling of the interview and coverage.\n\n\u201cOur intent was to convey the emotion that Bode Miller was feeling after winning his bronze medal. We understand how some viewers thought the line of questioning went too far, but it was our judgment that his answers were a necessary part of the story. We\u2019re gratified that Bode has been publicly supportive of Christin Cooper and the overall interview.\u201d"

      "source": "American Hustle and 12 Years a Slave emerged as the early frontrunners for awards season, as both films picked up seven nominations at the 71st annual Golden Globes. David O Russell's conman caper dominated the Globes' comedy-or-musical section, while Steve McQueen's slavery saga held sway in the neighbouring drama category. The race towards Oscar night now looks set to pit the disreputable crime romp against the weighty expose of institutionalised American evil.\n\nBased on Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, 12 Years a Slave stars the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor as a free man from New York state, sold into bondage in Louisiana. Its nominations include best director, best dramatic actor and the crowning best film drama.\n\nAmerican Hustle, meanwhile, stars Christian Bale and Amy Adams as a pair of con artists who find themselves press-ganged into helping with an FBI operation. It was shortlisted for best comedy-or-musical, in addition to the best actor and actress prizes in the comedy-or-musical section. The two main contenders are only brought together in the directing category, where O Russell and McQueen are bracketed alongside Paul Greengrass (for Captain Phillips), Alexander Payne (Nebraska) and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Gravity).\n\nAnnounced at a dawn press conference in Beverly Hills, the Globe nominations spelled good news for British acting talent. In addition to Ejiofor and Bale, the race finds room for Idris Elba (nominated for his role in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom), Kate Winslet (Labor Day), Emma Thompson (Saving Mr Banks), Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine) and Judi Dench (Philomena).\n\nIn the immediate wake of the announcement, bookmakers established Cate Blanchett as the favourite to win the dramatic actress award for her acclaimed, anguished turn in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, with Greta Gerwig tipped to win the comedy-or-musical prize for her performance in Noah Baumbach's Frances Ha. Ejiofor is the runaway frontrunner for the best dramatic actor Globe, while 77-year-old Bruce Dern looks to have the edge in the neighbouring category thanks to his role as a desperate American dreamer in Payne's black-and-white Nebraska.\n\nElsewhere, several of the year's most critically acclaimed pictures were left to fight it out in the best foreign language section. The sidebar is dominated by the French romance Blue Is the Warmest Colour, winner of the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes film festival, and the dark Italian satire The Great Beauty, which swept the European film awards last weekend.

      "source": "The New England Patriots\u2019 trade of defensive lineman Richard Seymour to the Oakland Raiders on Sunday in exchange for a first-round draft pick in 2011 indicates several things about how the Patriots view the N.F.L.\n\n\u00b6They were unlikely to re-sign Seymour, who was entering the final year of his contract but who had been less dominant in recent years as he battled injuries. At 29, Seymour, who led the team with eight sacks last season, would seem to have several prime playing years left. But defensive tackle Vince Wilfork\u2019s contract is also set to expire after the season (among several others) and the Patriots will most likely now devote time \u2014 and the money they will save by parting with Seymour \u2014 to keeping Wilfork in the fold.\n\n\u00b6They are betting the Raiders will still not be good in 2010, which means the first rounder the Patriots acquire could be in the top 10 or even the top 5 in the college draft. That is probably a safe bet considering the Raiders just gave up a first-round pick for a player without a long-term contract in a year when they might not finish above .500.\n\n\u00b6They may also be gambling that there will be a rookie wage cap in place by 2011 as part of a new collective bargaining agreement. Then, after years of teams trying to trade out of the top few draft spots because of the crushing financial commitments that go with them, the top few picks would become extremely valuable again. It is a calculated risk. There might not be a rookie cap, which would make a high-first-round pick unattractive for the fiscally prudent Patriots. But if there is a lockout in 2011, the Patriots would get to exercise the pick in the draft that will still be held.\n\nAlthough the trade of Seymour, who was the first-round pick in 2001, was a surprise, coming just one day after teams made their roster cuts, it was not out of character for Coach Bill Belichick, who likes to accumulate draft picks as a means to sustaining the Patriots\u2019 success.\n\n\u201cAny transaction we make is with the goal of what is best for our team and, as difficult as it is to part ways with a player of Richard\u2019s stature, many factors were taken into account when we considered this trade,\u201d Belichick said in a statement. \u201cAs an organization, we feel the trade with Oakland brings sufficient value and is in the long-term interest of the club.\u201d\n\nStill, the short-term impact of Seymour\u2019s departure could be significant. At 6 feet 6 inches and 310 pounds, he was the kind of presence of the defensive line that opponents had to focus on. He was a three-time All-Pro and was part of the Patriots\u2019 three Super Bowl titles. The Patriots have good depth on the defensive line \u2014 Wilfork and Ty Warren are the returning starters \u2014 and Seymour\u2019s departure most likely means a greater role for Jarvis Green at a time that the Patriots have been practicing more four-man lines during the preseason.\n\nThe defense will now be younger, although without four of the most prominent faces from their Super Bowl teams: Mike Vrabel (traded to the Chiefs), Tedy Bruschi and Rodney Harrison (retired) and Seymour. Still, the Patriots\u2019 offense could be so explosive this season that it will cover up for any adjustment pains the defense suffers."

      "source": "So how is President Barack Obama doing after his first 100 days in office? That depends on whom you ask. Democrats are standing solidly behind their man. Republicans fear he is the incarnation of their worst nightmares. Independents like him, and he is building their trust as a problem solver in dire economic times.\n\nSo overall, Obama is doing quite well. Our Zogby International polling shows him retaining all the support he had on Election Day, and Republicans having no success in souring opinions on Obama among swing voters.\n\nObama has passed a stimulus bill, delivered executive orders that please the Democratic base without alienating independents and begun re-building relationships with foreign leaders who were turned off by the Bush administration's \"you're with us or you're against us\" diplomacy.\n\nObama has so far skillfully (or maybe just luckily) escaped much of the fallout from an enormously unpopular banking policy. In our March 31 interactive poll, only 6% of adults chose the policy of providing money to banks and buying their troubled assets--the policy promoted by both Bush and Obama--as the best way to deal with the problem. (Fifty-one percent would end any government funding, even if that meant bank failures; and 32% would have the government temporarily take over the most troubled banks.)\n\nBank executives and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner have played the role of bad guys. At some point, Obama will be seen as owning his banking policy and responsible for its success or failure.\n\nPopulist liberals are among the harshest critics of bailout policies that, in the words of Steelworkers Union President Leo Gerard, \"will bail out those who shower before work but not those who shower afterward.\" Bank bailouts are just one of the issues where some on the left expect more from Obama. Other issues include investigating torture policy under the Bush administration and civil liberties on the matter of detainees.\n\nMost of the heat is coming from liberal bloggers and columnists, but not much from Congress or interest groups. With major pieces of legislation on the table, the Democratic players know that Obama must be seen as strong and popular for any of these to succeed. Unions want changes in labor laws that make it easier to organize. Environmentalists want measures that reduce carbon emissions. Everyone on the left wants some form of universal health care that includes a government insurance option.\n\nPrograms addressing those liberal demands are among the reasons Obama may never get the approval of the Republican base that makes up about 30% of the electorate; or the legislative support of most Republicans in Congress. After failing to get a single GOP vote for the stimulus bill in the House, Obama seems ready to move on his agenda without Congressional Republicans.\n\nPlaying hardball with Republicans on the Hill may make sense, but ignoring the tax and spending concerns of conservative voters does not. While much of the Tea Party movement may have been orchestrated by Republican activists and their media allies, some participants expressed traditional economic values that appeal to independents. These include independence from government and controlled spending and taxes.\n\nThese independent voters, and many others, have doubts about government stimulus spending. Obama is clearly aware of this. Witness Obama's April 25 radio address promoting \"pay-as-you-go\" legislation and his order for his Cabinet to quickly find $100 million in spending cuts.\n\nAs demonstrated by his brilliant presidential campaign, Obama and his team understand the American electorate. We remain a deeply polarized nation, with Democrats right now outnumbering Republicans. Winning elections and policy victories still requires support from a majority of unaffiliated voters.\n\nIndependent voters see Obama as a calm and thoughtful problem solver. That impression, more than any actual decisions or actions made during his first 100 days in office, is why Obama is off to a successful start.\n\nJohn Zogby is president and CEO of Zogby International and the author of The Way We'll Be: The Zogby Report on the Transformation of the American Dream.

In western areas, precipitation is already beginning to taper off and could be done by around 11 a.m. The rest of the area may well the precipitation end between 11 a.m and noon, from west to east.\n\n10:10 a.m. update: Snowfall total reports from the National Weather Service from the National Weather Service indicate the heaviest totals have occurred in northern Maryland (as expected). In Allegany County, Maryland \u2013 where 6 to 8 inches accumulated. In Washington and Frederick counties, generally 2-4 inches have been reported.\n\n10:05 a.m. update: We\u2019re getting some reports of sleet in the northern and western half of Montgomery County, and even some snow around Damascus. Although there may be some brief slushiness in this area, this shouldn\u2019t be overly disruptive as this storm is trucking. The heaviest precipitation has already passed to the east and we can start to see signs of the back edge along the I-81 corridor in western Virginia. So even in areas of Frederick and western Loudoun county where it\u2019s snowing, don\u2019t expect a lot of additional accumulation (more than 1 inch or 2). For a lot of the region, precipitation could even start tapering off prior to noon.\n\n9:25 a.m. update: Let\u2019s talk about the rain for a second. Through 9 a.m. Reagan National and Dulles airports had picked up 1.14\u2033 and 1.15\u2033 respectively. That would\u2019ve been some serious snow.

In short, even though we lowered totals in some of our northern and western areas and don\u2019t expect a high impact, wintry weather is still like there along with some slick roads over the next several hours.

For Loudoun, northern Howard and northwest Montgomery County \u2013 a little snow accumulation could still occur (and may not), but it shouldn\u2019t cause huge problems.\n\nSome slushiness is being reported around Round Hill in western Loudoun.\n\nSleet and slush in 20141 @nbcwashington @WTOP @capitalweather #vawx pic.twitter.com/9ldv9FX1kH\n\n\u2014 DisasterGirl (@Do_ThereIsNoTry) February 3, 2014\n\n6:30 a.m. update: Dual polarization doppler radar has a product which provides a great approximation of the rain/snow line. (It\u2019s called correlation coefficient, for a nice lay person\u2019s explanation, click here). In the image below, the rain/snow line pops out prominently as the yellow line separating the two red regions \u2013 basically cutting through western Loudoun county and then into Frederick and northeast into central Carroll county.\n\nApproximation of rain/snow line (via dual-polarization radar) at 6:20 a.m. (RadarScope)\n\n6:15 a.m. update: Based on models and observations this morning (temperatures well above freezing, upper 30s to near 40 at 6 a.m.), we can take the \u201cboom\u201d scenario off the table in terms of meaningful snow in the immediate metro area and do not expect widespread road and travel concerns (although heavy rain and eventually mixed precipitation may slow things down a bit).\n\nSnow and/or sleet that falls will likely be \u201cconversational\u201d (mostly not sticking, except perhaps slushiness on grassy areas) and the changeover from rain \u2013 if it occurs \u2013 may take into mid-to-late morning. In our colder suburbs to the northwest (Montgomery, Loudoun and Howard counties) in the advisory area, we favor the low end of our forecast snow totals in the map below, with a gradual transition to mixed precipitation and snow in the next couple of hours.\n\n@capitalweather changing over to snow in Airmont (western loudoun)\n\n\u2014 Joyce Shanholtzer (@JoyceShanholtz) February 3, 2014\n\n@capitalweather Switchover just happened in Frederick/Ft. Detrick (let the dogs over 5 mins ago in rain; snowing now).\n\n\u2014 eman (@snarkarina) February 3, 2014\n\nWe continue to expect significant accumulating snow in northern Maryland, where a changeover from rain to sleet and snow is ongoing. Already, some locations in western Maryland (Allegany County) have received 1-4 inches.\n\n5:15 a.m. update: Moderate to heavy rain is bursting into the area but temperatures \u2013 at the moment \u2013 are too warm for frozen precipitation (except in western Maryland and West Virginia, where snow has begun). At 5 a.m., Reagan National was 42, and Dulles 38, with rain. To the north and west, Frederick and Hagerstown both had rain at 37 and 33. Per our forecast below, these colder areas should begin mixing with and changing to sleet and snow over the next hour or two.\n\n@hbwx we now have a sleet/rain mix in Martinsburg.\n\n\u2014 laneta kauffman (@ljkauffman) February 3, 2014\n\n@JacquiJeras already heavy snow and sticking in Berkeley Springs about an inch so far\n\n\u2014 John Haymann (@k8rcc) February 3, 2014\n\nOvernight, the National Weather Service lowered its snowfall forecast around the metro region and its now more or less in line with ours \u2013 on the lower end. Still, conditions \u2013 especially our colder suburbs \u2013 will change quickly this morning, so monitor them closely and allow for the possibility you may need to allow some extra time to get places. Our next update will be in another hour or so.\n\n*** Read below for the full forecast through the weekend, published at 5 a.m. \u2013 although note today\u2019s forecast has been revised per updates above ***\n\nA somewhat subjective rating of the day\u2019s weather, on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nA sloppy mix of cold rain, sleet, and pasty snow doesn\u2019t excite this snow lover.\n\nToday: Rain, sleet, and snow, ending in the afternoon. Highs 35-40.\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy. Lows: 25-30.\n\nTomorrow: Mostly cloudy. Highs near 40.\n\nExpect a little bit of everything (even the unexpected?) this morning as a complex but intense storm bolts through the region. The D.C. area sits right on the rain-snow line which gradually creeps southeastward. Rain comes first but mixes with and changes to sleet and snow, especially north and west of the Beltway, where the accumulation prospects are highest.\n\nThe storm pulls away this afternoon, but we don\u2019t catch much of a break before the next storm system arrives Tuesday night, with more mixed precipitation possible in our colder areas. Our respite arrives midday Wednesday into Friday, but the third in this week\u2019s parade of storms may cause trouble this weekend.\n\nTemperatures: Latest D.C. area temperature map. See interactive map on our Weather Wall.\n\nToday (Monday): Most everyone starts the day with rain, but in Loudoun and Frederick counties, the rain should fairly quickly begin to mix with and change to sleet and then snow between about 5:30 and 7:30 a.m. In northern Fauquier, western Fairfax, Montgomery and Howard counties, the transition to frozen precipitation probably occurs in the 6:30 to 8:30 a.m. window. Elsewhere, the changeover to sleet and snow from rain occurs more slowly and may not complete itself, especially from downtown and to the south and east.\n\nPrecipitation falls intensely at times through late morning, and heavy, wet snow may start to pile up, especially in northwest Loudoun, Frederick and western Howard counties. Closer to the District, accumulation prospects are iffier and more rain/sleet may fall, but sleet could cause some slick spots, and conditions will need to be closely monitored, so stay tuned to our live updates above.\n\nTemperatures this morning range from 31-37 (northwest to southeast) across the region. By early afternoon, precipitation rapidly begins to taper off, with highs 35-40. Light winds from the north at around 10 mph. Confidence:Low-Medium\n\nCapital Weather Gang snowfall forecast map issued 5 a.m. Monday morning\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy skies with possible areas of fog. Lows range from the mid-to-upper 20s in the colder suburbs to 30-32 downtown. Winds are light out of the north. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFor related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend\u2026\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): Mostly cloudy (maybe some intervals of sun in the morning), and chilly, with highs near 40. Winds are light from the northeast at around 5-10 mph. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Rain develops between 8 p.m. and midnight, except possible freezing rain north and west of the Beltway. Lows range from 30-34 (suburbs-city). We\u2019re not expecting a major ice storm where freezing rain occurs, but a light glaze is possible. We\u2019ll have more on this after today\u2019s storm winds down. Confidence: Medium\n\nA daily assessment of the potential for at least ~1\u2033 of snow in the next week, on a 0-10 scale.\n\n5 (\u2192) 50/50 chance of 1\u2033+ today seems about right. Weekend storm still hanging out there.\n\nRain ends Wednesday morning (except freezing rain well north and west of the District in colder pockets of Loudoun and Frederick counties, perhaps) by around 10 a.m., followed by partly to mostly cloudy skies, and highs 45-50. Turning colder Wednesday night, with lows in the low 20s in the colder suburbs to the upper 20s downtown. Confidence: Medium\n\nA quier stretch Thursday through Friday, with partly sunny skies and seasonably cool temperatures. Highs both days are in the mid-30s to near 40, with overnight lows mainly in the 20s. Confidence: Medium\n\nThe weekend is a giant question mark right now, but low pressure developing in the Gulf of Mexico is likely to make a move northeast. Precipitation, quite possibly in the frozen form (a wintry mix or snow) at least to start, has a good chance of moving into our area \u2013 but the timing could be Saturday or Sunday. The exact track of the storm will determine whether and when any frozen precipitation turns over to rain. Temperatures should remain on the chilly side, with highs in the 30s, and lows 25-30. Confidence: Low-Medium"

      "source": "Sept. 20, 2011, 12:29 p.m.\n\n9:52 p.m. | Updated In his first policy address since becoming schools chancellor in April, Dennis M. Walcott announced on Tuesday that New York would open 50 new middle schools in the next two years, many in the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nThe city will also apply for about $30 million in federal money to replace teachers and leadership, while keeping students in place, at five struggling schools for each of the next two years, the chancellor said.\n\nWhile the plan, outlined in a speech at the Kimmell Center of New York University, got a warm welcome from educators in the audience, it drew a more guarded response from others, including the president of the teachers\u2019 union, Michael Mulgrew, who said Mr. Walcott was not going far enough.\n\n\u201cWe need a strategy that focuses on instruction and lowering class size,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said in an interview. \u201cRearranging the deck chairs isn\u2019t going to do it.\u201d\n\nA proposal to get middle schools to focus on literacy was on target, Mr. Mulgrew said. But he pointed out that many students read below grade level and asked, \u201cWhere is the plan to train teachers to adapt literacy skills into the curriculum?\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Walcott said he planned to follow the federal \u201cturnaround\u201d model to transform some troubled schools, meaning at least half of a school\u2019s staff members would be reassigned. That approach \u201cwill foster new possibilities in teacher compensation,\u201d he said, hinting at possible bonus pay for teachers who accept more difficult assignments.\n\nMr. Walcott also announced that an entire incoming class of the New York Teaching Fellows Program will be trained to work in middle schools in poor neighborhoods, where vacancies are hardest to fill.\n\nIt was unclear how many of the 50 new schools would be charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently operated, and how many would be traditional schools. But while the chancellor praised some district-run schools, his plan to improve middle school performance called largely for using techniques borrowed from the city\u2019s successful charters, including emphases on discipline and routines and on preparing all students for college.\n\nThere are about 400 schools in the city serving grades 6 through 8; 59 of those are charters.\n\nMr. Mulgrew said he was troubled by the suggestion that strategies used by charter schools might be seen as a solution. Because the schools tend to enroll fewer English-language learners and special-education students, he said, their achievements must be measured differently.\n\nSeth Andrew, the founder and superintendent of Democracy Prep, a network of charter schools in Harlem serving students from grades 6 through 12, said a culture of discipline and academic rigor, coupled with longer school days, could yield benefits. Students at Mr. Andrew\u2019s schools spend nine and a half hours in school each day, and his 9th and 10th graders have consistently had passing rates of 90 percent on Regents exams.\n\nRobert L. Hughes, the president of New Visions for Public Schools, which runs more than 70 public schools in the city, mostly in high-needs neighborhoods, said the key to the success of Mr. Walcott\u2019s plan was enlisting help from outside the schools. \u201cIt\u2019s got to include dropout prevention, community programs, psychological support,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, Ernest A.

      "source": "Two years ago employees at Austin-based software company Square Root had a big problem. \u201cThere were 35 of us and only two bathrooms,\u201d complained Mary Feild, the marketing coordinator at Square Root. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d The situation wasn\u2019t going to change anytime soon either. CEO Chris Taylor knew he had a problem, but he was also trying desperately to close on a new office near the startup\u2019s two existing buildings.\n\nIn the meantime, Taylor says, he knew that while he couldn\u2019t solve the problem, he could at least acknowledge it. So he had a service come three times a week to clean the company\u2019s two bathrooms. He also ordered a custom-designed toilet-shaped pi\u00f1ata from a local company to hang on the front porch of Square Root\u2019s office. Anyone who was frustrated with the bathroom situation could go beat the pi\u00f1ata. Feild and others did. The pi\u00f1ata is long gone, and now the company has 46 employees, six bathrooms, and $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nSee the full 25 Best Small Workplaces list here.\n\nSquare Root ranks No. 2 on this year\u2019s list from Great Place to Work of the 25 Best Small Workplaces because it has never once let up on its focus on culture. \u201cWe do an entire interview just for culture,\u201d says Baba Buehler, director of technology at Square Root, who has been at the company for five years. All job candidates are given problems to take home; they then return and present a solution. Because of the company\u2019s long hours, they must be excited about devoting time to problem solving with colleagues.\n\nThe company builds a software product that helps sales managers analyze and store data. Its customers include Nissan, Volkswagen VLKAF , and other automotive companies. This year it is working to expand into the retail and restaurant sector as well. Taylor says that since it\u2019s a bootstrapped tech firm, culture is its best recruiting tool. Much of its feel-at-home, just-be-yourself culture has developed through Square Root\u2019s choice of offices.\n\nTaylor first purchased an old Craftsman-style home a little more than a mile from downtown Austin in 2009 to house his four-person company. Two years later he purchased the house next door, since the company was outgrowing its headquarters. The original office was known as the Red House, and the office next door by its street number, 506.\n\nWhen Square Root reached 12 people, Taylor decided to move half the team next door, but during a meeting two months later someone made a crack about \u201cthose people in the Red House.\u201d Taylor stopped the meeting and that afternoon moved everyone back into the Red House, turning the house next door into conference rooms.\n\nSquare Root now has four houses, each with a living room and some featuring a compelling theme. There\u2019s the Craft Brew House, which contains the company dartboard, and the Quiet House, where excessive conversation isn\u2019t permitted.\n\nTo ensure that the engineers don\u2019t all cluster in one house while the data scientists roam the halls of another, Square Root has implemented cross-functional teams, which they call herds, that put members of the engineering, product management, and data analytics groups together daily. The use of herds, Square Root says, refers to a companywide affection for goats. (\u201cIt\u2019s a software thing.\u201d)\n\nIn an example of how democratic the culture is at Square Root, an employee who had been on the job less than a month contributed a video and blog post that helped give the herd concept its final shape. Outside their herds, departments still have meetings twice a month and report to managers.\n\nAs the company approaches 50 employees, the next big question is how to grow bigger without losing the startup culture that has defined it for the past six years. And there are also the questions of how to find additional houses in real-estate-constrained Austin and what amenities to pack into them. \u201cI\u2019m not going downtown,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be competing against Google GOOG , which has taken 200,000 square feet of space. We just can\u2019t win at that game.\u201d\n\nFor more, visit 50 Best Small and Medium-Size Companies to Work For list.\n\nA version of this article appears in the November 1, 2015 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cShepherding great culture.\u201d"

The debates were notable for the candidates speaking for 60- and 90-minute stretches, uninterrupted. Not exactly an exciting format for today\u2019s short attention spans.\n\nAs former House Speaker Gingrich walked into the site with his wife, Callista, we asked whether he planned to speak for 90 minutes uninterrupted, as in the original debates. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s Obama.\u201d\n\nKing joked that because the two Georgians in the race are debating in Texas, someone ought to get the two Texans in the race to debate in Georgia.

Friday evening, Gingrich was a hit at the\n\nof Iowa\u2019s annual dinner, garnering the warmest reception of the five candidates who showed up. (Cain and former Massachusetts Gov.

Some political observers have predicted that Gingrich -- who has often taken the role of the elder statesman on the stump and in debates, refusing to criticize his rivals, and instead turning his fire on\n\n\u2014is about to have a moment in the sun.\n\nKing wasn\u2019t sure about that, but he didn\u2019t downplay the evening: \u201cHere tonight, this could be a debate that could be very significant in turning the direction of the contest.\u201d"

I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand and I felt the bone flex, and when I got to the point where I felt like it was going to snap I had to tap out.\u201d\n\nBefore the show aired, Rosolie told the Discovery Channel that the ordeal hadn\u2019t left him completely unscathed, saying he was \u201cpretty beaten up.\u201d (The snake was apparently unharmed.)\n\nThe reaction to Rosolie not being ingested by the anaconda was swift, with alternate title suggestions and comparisons to other poorly received Sunday night TV shows helping the show's hashtag receive not-exactly-positive attention on Twitter.\n\nHey @discovery, can I have my own show? #EatenAlive pic.twitter.com/OLEZykn1sx\n\nBut Rosolie is likely satisfied with the outcome, and not just because he avoided becoming a snake\u2019s dinner; he told People magazine before the show aired that his real mission was to get people thinking about the \u201cresource extraction\u201d taking place in the world\u2019s rainforests. \u201cI wanted to try to do something that would shock people and get a lot of attention and to start a conversation on a bigger stage than it is right now,\u201d he said.\n\nPerhaps that can be followed by a conversation about the sordid reasons behind humans\u2019 desire to see others literally enter a beast\u2019s belly."

      "source": "You are no longer the sucker you used to be.\n\nSo suggests continuing research from the Stanford Graduate School of Business into the challenges marketers face in reaching consumers in the digital age. As you might suspect, the research shows that a wealth of online product information and user reviews is causing a fundamental shift in how consumers make decisions.\n\nAs consumers rely more on one another, the power of marketers is being undermined, said Itamar Simonson, a Stanford marketing professor and the lead researcher.\n\nIn the study, participants were asked which of three Canon cameras they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to buy. Before deciding, they were allowed to spend a few minutes reading user reviews and other information about these and other cameras on Amazon.com.\n\nTo get the full impact of the findings, you first have to know the conclusions of a similar experiment decades ago by Dr. Simonson, then at Duke. In it, some subjects chose among three Minolta cameras: an inexpensive one, a midprice one and an expensive one. Another group was given a choice of just two of the Minoltas: the midprice one and the less expensive one.\n\nThe researchers found that when study subjects had only two choices, most chose the less expensive camera with fewer features. But when given three choices, most chose the middle one. Dr. Simonson called it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe compromise effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the idea that consumers will gravitate to the middle of the options presented to them.\n\nThe study showed how marketers could manipulate consumers. Just by presenting three differently priced options, they could get consumers to gravitate to a midprice one from a less expensive one. This finding further led Dr. Simonson and other scholars to describe widespread \u00e2\u0080\u009cirrational\u00e2\u0080\u009d behavior by consumers who made decisions not based on a product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual value but on how the item was presented relative to other products.\n\nFlash forward to the new experiment. It was similar to the first, except that consumers could have a glimpse at Amazon. That made a huge difference. When given three camera options, consumers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gravitate en masse to the midprice version. Rather, the least expensive one kept its share and the middle one lost more to the most expensive one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe compromise effect was gone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Simonson, or, rather, he nearly exclaimed the absence of the effect, underscoring his surprise at the findings. They are to be published next month in \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsolute Value,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a book by Dr. Simonson and Emanuel Rosen.\n\nToday, products are being evaluated more on their \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolute value, their quality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Simonson said. Brand names mean less. The results suggest that companies should spend less money trying to shape consumer opinions in traditional ads, he said, and more on understanding what and who are shaping those opinions.\n\nRan Kivetz, a marketing professor at Columbia who did his dissertation at Stanford under Dr. Simonson, calls the new findings \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery significant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but sees a catch: Digital tools can change the compromise effect but strengthen companies in other ways, letting them gather consumer data and gain instant feedback on what marketing ideas work. In theory, it could lead to more powerful, if subtler, manipulation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a marketer and I want to manipulate choices using the compromise effect, it will be harder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Kivetz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another side, which is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier for the marketer to present information in different ways and to rapidly learn what people respond to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"

And there are the scandals, and her negatives are so high.\u201d\n\nAnd Biden? \u201cI would love for him to get in; he\u2019s a great alternative to Hillary.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy fear is that splits the party,\u2019\u2019 said her husband, \u201cbut he\u2019d be an amazing candidate as well.\u201d\n\nGale Jones Carson, an official with a Memphis utility company, said she likes Clinton but learned her lesson about committing to a candidate too early in 2008, when she went for Clinton \u201cand then Obama got in the race.\u2019\u2019 Particularly as an African American, \u201cthat was not easy in Memphis. But, once you give your word, you have to stick with it.\u201d\n\nRunning for president \u201cis grueling, hard, dirty, nasty, and he just lost a son,\u2019\u2019 she said of Biden. She, too, lost a son, years ago, and \u201cwhen I finally got up, I\u2019ve kept moving ever since, and that\u2019s how I survived,\u201d she said, adding that maybe a run would be good for him. \u201cBut ultimately,\u2019\u2019 she hopes the only voice he listens to is in his own gut. \u201cThe only thing that matters is what he wants.\u201d\n\nKansas City Mayor Sly James said he\u2019s been with Clinton \u201cfor quite some time\u201d and though he won\u2019t be switching sides no matter who gets in, he does think a Biden run might benefit his candidate: \u201cI think he would sharpen the debate. Secretary Clinton is at her best when she\u2019s pushed and challenged, and I\u2019m not sure [a Biden candidacy] is a bad thing, or something to be feared.\u201d\n\nVoting no way on a Biden run was Kathryn Manento, of Minneapolis, who\u2019s getting ready to launch a small business: \u201cIt would be nice\u2014really nice\u2014to see a lady president,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Hillary\u2019s turn, and I hope a lot of old-time Democrats will be loyal.\u201d\n\nOf Biden, she said, \u201cI know he\u2019s been a good vice president, but he will not generate as much enthusiasm\u201d as Clinton, she feels. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to see President Clinton and Chelsea out in front again; she\u2019s a darling young lady.\u201d\n\nWhile other candidates have ventured to weigh in on the subject of whether Biden will enter the race\u2014\u201cMy two dollar bet is that he does get in,\u201d said Lincoln Chafee, who is also seeking the nomination\u2014Hillary Clinton herself is staying mostly quiet on the subject, giving Biden space to make his decision. \"I'm not going to comment on differences or similarities,\" she said on Friday."

      "source": "'Parking problems date to ancient Rome. Julius Caesar banned vehicles from the city center at certain times to cut congestion, forcing drivers to stow them on the periphery.'\n\nMy wife andI went shopping last night at a local megamall. By the time we'd finished eating at an adjacent restaurant, the mall itself was closed, which obliged us to walk all the way around it to get back to our car\u2014a surreal schlep across several hundred acres of empty parking lot. The sodium vapor lighting hummed overhead. The sky was orange, and the stars obliterated. A huge and miserable barrenness lay all around us, like a hardpan ocean.\n\nSurface parking lots are the largest built structures we come into contact with, and yet they are so ubiquitous and familiar that they have become a visual given, the dark matter in the automotive cosmos. So much effort and status is invested in the architecture of commercial buildings; it's remarkable that so little thought is given to the mesas of tarmac on which they sit. Eran Ben-Joseph's tidy study of surface parking lots makes these invisible spaces visible. Read these pages and you'll never un-see a parking lot again.\n\nParking problems predate the car. The original sin might have been Julius Caesar's. In the early 40s B.C., he prohibited chariots and large horse-drawn carts from Rome's commercial district at certain hours (much as London's anti-congestion regulations impose a fee on drivers entering the city center). The early chaos of 20th-century automobility spurred the development of \"off-street\" parking, with the first surface lots emerging in the 1920s. The soaring rates of private automobile ownership, particularly by women day-shoppers, left cities with few options. An attempt by Los Angeles in 1920 to ban private-car parking downtown resulted in an almost immediate collapse of local business. The ban was overturned 17 days later. By midcentury in America, with downtown merchants fleeing to the suburbs and building stock being pulled down, it was considered enlightened public policy to use surface lots as placeholders until long-term redevelopment could take hold.\n\nBy Eran Ben-Joseph MIT, 157 pages, $24.95\n\nAlong the way, cities developed zoning formulas to determine the number of parking spaces needed\u2014typically, between six and 10 spaces per 1,000 square feet of floor space. Mr. Ben-Joseph argues\u2014as did Donald Shoup in \"The High Cost of Free Parking\" (2005)\u2014that these ratios created an enormous oversupply of parking, designed to accommodate only two or three days of maximum use per year, like Black Friday. This seemingly minor miscalculation has had a dramatic effect on urban environments. In some U.S. cities, such as Little Rock, Ark., surface lots cover nearly a third of the land area. Mr. Ben-Joseph estimates that there are 500 million surface-lot parking spaces in the U.S., covering more than 3,590 square miles, a landmass larger than Puerto Rico.\n\nSurface parking lots don't have to be ugly. As Mr. Ben-Joseph notes, a canopy of trees is an easy way to relieve the visual awfulness of a typical lot. Trees also help mitigate parking lots' contribution to the urban heat-island effect, in which vast stretches of blacktop act as thermal batteries, storing the sun's energy and radiating it back into the air at night.\n\nMr. Ben-Joseph estimates that planting enough trees to shade 50% of the surface-lot area in the U.S. would remove 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere and return 822,000 tons of oxygen. Unfortunately, he also estimates that the area currently shaded by trees to be around 2%. That's a lot of missing trees. Landscape design requirements for surface lots are typically weak and often left to developers' most minimal\u2014that is, cheapest\u2014interpretation.\n\nThe result is the sort of scant landscaping I saw in the mall parking lot: Marooned on tiny vegetated islands hundreds of yards apart were solitary river birches, too small and widely spaced to do much good.\n\nAs we walked across the lot we could also see, embedded in shallow swales, grated iron storm drains. Parking lots, typically built with impermeable asphalt and concrete curbing, contribute to water pollution and flash flooding by shunting rainwater (and contaminants picked up along the way) into creeks and streams rather than allowing the water to infiltrate the ground to recharge aquifers. An acre of parking lot produces 16 times the amount of runoff as an acre of grass. There are ways to make parking lots permeable: open paving blocks, for instance, or \"bio-swales,\" which temporarily impound water before releasing it into the ground. That same 50% of tree cover that would scrub CO2 and supply oxygen would also mitigate two billion cubic meters of storm-water runoff. But these measures, too, cost money.\n\nThe malign effects of cost-cutting are a running theme in Mr. Ben-Joseph's book. Surface parking lots are the way they are\u2014dirty, ugly, under-designed, badly lighted, unsustainable\u2014only because they are so cheap. A space on a surface lot costs about $4,000 to build. The same space in a parking deck costs about $10,000, and in an underground parking structure upward of $20,000. Parking lots are almost always cost-driven design disasters.\n\nMr. Ben-Joseph does offer some parking-lot success stories, few that there are. He introduces us to the Herman Miller factory in Cherokee County, Ga., whose segmented, 550-car lot is sympathetically integrated into the surrounding woodscape. He also approvingly notes the canopied car plaza in front of the Dia:Beacon Museum in Beacon, N.Y. (a collaboration between American artist Robert Irwin and the architecture firm OpenOffice), where the angled planters separating the parking spaces point the way to the museum entrance. Renzo Piano, redesigning the old Fiat Lingotto factory in Turin, Italy, took a similar approach, creating dense and splendid colonnades of trees.\n\nBut Mr. Ben-Joseph\u2014whose authorial temperament is as flat and smooth as freshly rolled macadam\u2014does not go so far as to \"champion the abolition of surface parking lots or . . . advocate the creation of strict codes and standards that dictate their design.\" In the spirit of the 20th-century landscape historian John Brinckerhoff Jackson, who preached a love of everyday places, Mr. Ben-Joseph seems to want to find beauty in these sad parcels, as they are.\n\nThat's an agreeable life strategy, finding the good in things. And yet it's also a source of frustration for the reader. Why doesn't he advocate for better standards? What prevents us from covering open lots with solar panels, a practice that, according to Mr. Ben-Joseph, could potentially generate enough electricity every day to power 11 million homes for a month? Frankly, I would like less in the way of academic musing and more in the way of prescriptive solutions.\n\nMr. Ben-Joseph is also guilty of sociological overreach. \"Parking lots are a central part of our social and cultural life,\" he writes, calling them \"a modern-day common.\" Wait, what? They are? Yes, teenagers gather in parking lots for one rite of adolescence or another: fighting, racing, dancing. True, community farmers markets spring up over the weekend in business and municipal parking lots; tailgating is a ritualized feasting before sporting events; RV drivers form impromptu villages in Wal-Mart parking lots, a practice known as \"boondocking.\"\n\nBut these interactions happen despite the forbidding nature of open parking lots, not because of them. I find parking lots to be intensely anti-social. I do not engage with strangers on my way to or from the car, and because these tracts are typically shelterless, there is no architectural cue as to where to congregate even if you wanted to. One can't let go of a child's hand in a parking lot for even a second. If you're in a car, a parking lot is an obstacle course to negotiate. If you're on foot, it's a place to escape unscathed.\n\nSurface parking lots don't have to be the minimalist slabs of nowhere-ness we've grown accustomed to, Mr. Ben-Joseph suggests. Maybe. And yet there are few signs that this aspect of our infrastructure will get much better anytime soon. For now, I was glad to reach my car and drive away.\n\nA version of this article appeared April 14, 2012, on page C6 in some U.S. editions of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: I Know It's Here Somewhere."

      "source": "Over the last decade or so, travel to Haiti from the U.S. was usually predicated on business or being a member of a NGO providing aid after the horrific earthquake of 2010. Times are changing, and Haiti has bounced back and now finds itself on a variety of vacation \"hot lists.\" Part of the country's fresh appeal is its vitality as it continues to dig out from under the remaining effects of the earthquake. New hotels are springing up, infrastructure is being improved, and new resort destinations have made their way from the drawing board to works in progress.\n\nAlong with this vitality come challenges, and the level of services in Haiti can at times fall short of those a traveler will experience at more fortunate destinations in the Caribbean. The upside of these challenges is no one will go to Haiti for the first time and express an attitude of \"been there, done that.\" In my experience, Haiti is a thrilling vacation destination for enthusiastic travelers, rather than blas\u00e9 tourists.\n\nOn arrival at the A\u00e9roport Toussaint L'Ouverture in Port-au-Prince, it can be a bit of a mad swirl at the exit, with Haitians pressing forward with offers of rides and help with luggage. It's best to arrange an airport pickup in advance with either your hotel or a reliable tour operator. The main language is French and Haitian Creole, so communication will sometimes be a challenge. Currency is the Haitian gourde, which hovers around 55 Haitian gourdes to one U.S. dollar. It's important to note that while Haitians are friendly, they can also be quite reserved; always ask first before you snap a person's photo.\n\nSafety is still an issue in Haiti. I'm looking forward to the day when I can write otherwise. Until then, it's best to travel accompanied by a savvy local tour operator. During my visit, I was whisked around the country by Bobby Chauvet at Agence Citadelle in Port-Au-Prince and Jean Lionel Pressoir at Tour Haiti in Petion-Ville. Both kept things rolling, packing the most into a day, all the while imparting a lot of insider knowledge about the country.\n\nVisitors will have a wide choice of hotels to choose from, especially in the capital city of Port au Prince and the outlying suburb of Petionville. Some hotels have been around for decades, including such first class properties as NH Haiti El Rancho and Hotel Montana. There are newer builds also, including familiar brand names familiar to US travelers, such as Best Western Premier Petion-Ville and Marriott Port-au-Prince Hotel. Those in search of colorful lodgings may want to give the historic Hotel Oloffson a try. This is one of the most famous hotels in the country, and over the years has hosted such luminaries as Graham Greene, Mick Jagger, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nOne tip: if you're main activities are going to center around Port-au-Prince, it would be a mistake to book accommodations in Petionville. Traffic between the city and the suburbs slows to a crawl during peak travel periods, and a lot of time will be wasted in transit.\n\nThere are a number of not-to-be-missed attractions in Port-au-Prince. A standout for me was the Iron Market, which was recently renovated. Here, visitors can browse display after display, from simple household items and produce to stalls displaying authentic Haitian artwork, including intriguing works associated with Vodou, such as Voodoo flags and Vodou spirit bottles. Travelers should also get themselves up to L'Observatoire, a mountaintop restaurant overlooking Port-au-Prince; they'll enjoy expansive vistas of the city, the Caribbean Sea and the surrounding countryside.\n\nHaiti has some of the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean and there are a variety of beach regions being developed. Meanwhile, the country's Arcadins Coast is convenient from Port-au-Prince, and has a selection of beach resorts.\n\nNot all of Haiti's sightseeing treasures lie in Port-au-Prince. Travelers with time in their schedules can set off overland or by domestic flight to visit the awe-inspiring Citadelle Laferri\u00e9re, a mountaintop 19th century fort in the northern region of Haiti. The fort was completed in 1820 and has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sans-Souci Palace lies nearby, and was the residence of Haiti's first black king, Henri Christophe, a leader in the country's successful slave rebellion.\n\nI've been traveling around the world for over 40 years, and have visited 54 countries. Touching down in Haiti last year was a beautiful shock to the system and brought me back to those exhilarating years of travel in my early 20s, when I was experiencing new cultures and countries for the first time. Haiti reinvigorated my passion for travel, and I'm already planning a return trip, where I can delve even deeper into the country's beauty and mystery.\n\nTo take a photo tour of Haiti's top sights, click through the carousel below.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story misstated the currency exchange rate of the Haitian gourde to the U.S. dollar. The correct rate is 55 Haitian gourdes to the one U.S. dollar."

      "source": "Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter will face a crucial test in the coming months over the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as pressure mounts on the Pentagon to resettle detainees overseas and help President Obama make good on one of his top national security goals.\n\nAdministration officials have been scrambling for months to devise a viable plan for shuttering the controversial military prison, a goal that Obama announced on his first day in office but that has been stalled for years by opposition in Congress and, internally, slowed by resistance at the Pentagon.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of progress, Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry have pressed Carter since he took over earlier this year to ensure that detainee resettlement occurs quickly.\n\n[Facing threat in Congress, Pentagon races to resettle Guantanamo inmates]\n\nIn late August, Carter and Obama met at the White House to discuss, among other issues, the effort to close Guantanamo by the time the president leaves office in 2017. At that meeting, Carter assured Obama that he was taking steps to break a bottleneck in the Pentagon\u2019s process and was working through most of the backlog of detainee transfers.\n\nCarter told the president that he had \u201ccleared the deck,\u201d meaning he had signed off on resettling all the detainees whose papers had reached his desk, the last step in a byzantine process across multiple agencies, according to one of several U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nBut most of those 12 transfers had been arranged months or even years earlier under previous secretaries. And there are still 114 detainees at the prison, a number the White House wants to bring well below 100 by the end of the year \u2014 a goal that will require the Pentagon to substantially accelerate the pace of detainee resettlement.\n\nMany officials are skeptical that a process that has been choked by bureaucratic infighting can be easily fixed. Particularly hard to overcome, they say, is the enduring reluctance of some military officials to free prisoners who they fear might take up arms against U.S. troops in the future.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of squandered opportunities,\u201d said a senior U.S. official, who added that Carter needs to show he\u2019s serious about closing the prison. \u201cThe clock is not our friend.\u201d\n\nShutting down Guantanamo \u2014 with its history of hunger strikes, harsh treatment and opaque military court proceedings \u2014 was supposed to illustrate Obama\u2019s break with the practices of President George W. Bush and the darkest aspects of the government\u2019s response to the 9/11 attacks. Instead, Obama\u2019s failure to overcome opposition to the prison\u2019s closure threatens to symbolize the unfulfilled ambitions of his presidency.\n\nNow, Carter is vowing to make the closing of the notorious prison a higher priority at the Pentagon, where the process has been slowed by concerns about releasing dangerous detainees.\n\nThe stakes are high for Carter, an experienced bureaucrat and former academic who replaced Chuck Hagel in February. Hagel\u2019s reluctance to authorize detainee transfers created friction with the White House and contributed to his early resignation.\n\n[Shaker Aamer, longtime Guantanamo Bay detainee, to be freed to Britain]\n\nOfficials at the Pentagon said the professorial Carter, who appeared to sympathize in his confirmation hearing with lawmakers\u2019 concerns about transfers, had pressed his staff after taking office about the details of proposed transfers \u2014 security guarantees in particular.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true to say that he scrutinizes everything we do with this in a way that really presses people to think about the risk,\u201d the first official said. By U.S. law, the defense secretary must personally vouch for the safety of all detainee transfers.\n\nLast month, Carter signed off on the transfer of Shaker Aamer, a British resident who was cleared for release in 2010 but whose release was not approved by previous defense secretaries. He also approved the repatriation of a Mauritanian detainee, Ahmed Ould Abdel al-Aziz, a deal that U.S. diplomats had lined up as early as 2009.\n\nYounis Abdurrahman Chekkouri, a Moroccan, was finally sent home in September, but officials said that the Moroccan government agreed to accept him in the summer of 2013.\n\nPentagon officials think that Carter\u2019s decision to sign off on long-delayed transfers is proof of his commitment to closing the prison. But his analytical approach may have also slowed those prisoners\u2019 release.\n\nOne former senior Pentagon official said that Carter, who served in the second-highest Pentagon position from 2011 to 2013, \u201cwasn\u2019t necessarily convinced initially\u201d that the prison needed to be shut but appeared to have embraced that goal over time.\n\nNo matter what, the former official said, \u201ceven if he has had ethical or moral disagreements about shutting it down, he will be the consummate staffer for the president\u201d and try to reduce detainee numbers at the prison.\n\nPentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that Carter would \u201ccontinue to expeditiously and deliberately consider the cases of other detainees eligible for transfer in collaboration with our interagency partners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe safety and security of the American people will remain his top priority in that process,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials at the Pentagon said that Carter had tasked additional officials to work on the Guantanamo closure process and had added urgency to a parallel effort to develop a plan for dealing with detainees who, if the prison is closed, would eventually be brought to the United States for trial or indefinite detention.\n\nAn earlier attempt to finalize that plan was derailed over the Justice Department\u2019s rejection of an Illinois prison as a site for holding Guantanamo prisoners.\n\nThe State Department, which leads negotiations with nations admitting detainees, has now lined up deals with about two dozen countries to take about half of the 54 Guantanamo prisoners who are eligible to be moved overseas. These detainees, none of whom have been charged with a crime, will continue to wait \u2014 until Carter approves their moves.\n\n[Issue of where to move Guantanamo detainees threatens closure plan]\n\nAccording to multiple officials, the conclusion of agreements to resettle prisoners in their home or third-party countries has long been slowed by repeated rounds of questions posed by Defense Department officials \u2014 about the details of security arrangements in countries where detainees will be released, travel restrictions for released detainees or other issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a time for questions, and there\u2019s a time for questions to end,\u201d another U.S. official said.\n\nFurther slowing the process, the officials say, is that the detention camp, perched on an isolated corner of Cuba, is primarily accessible by military aircraft, meaning that diplomats from countries considering accepting prisoners, and even officials from other agencies, rely on the Defense Department to arrange access to the facilities there.\n\nSome Pentagon officials have been skeptical of releasing detainees, especially after the political firestorm caused by last year\u2019s release of five Guantanamo prisoners in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier held captive in Pakistan.\n\nNot all recent transfers have gone well. Six months after six detainees were released to Uruguay last year, they were protesting outside the U.S. embassy, demanding greater assistance from the country that locked them up for years.\n\nMost inmates at Guantanamo have been locked up for as long as 14 years without being charged with a crime.\n\nWith Obama\u2019s 2017 departure in mind, the National Security Council in July implemented a new deadline for recommending detainees for transfer. Once the State Department finishes negotiations with a particular country, a six-agency review process will begin. Those agencies now have a week to sign off on transfer recommendations that will go to Carter for final approval.\n\nThe White House also took steps to ensure that questions about security guarantees are posed in a timely fashion and do not gum up negotiations with countries receiving detainees.\n\n\u201cThis is a priority,\u201d said Myles Caggins III, a White House spokesman. \u201cThe president\u2019s entire national security team is actively engaged in the effort to reduce the detainee population and ultimately close the detention facility at Guantanamo.\u201d\n\nSeveral officials said that the deadline has already been blown about a half-dozen times.\n\nOfficials said that Carter remained concerned about that effort to resettle prisoners, as politically fraught as it is, and that it will amount to little if the administration is unable to overcome congressional opposition to closing the prison.\n\nFurther complicating the White House\u2019s plans to shut the prison is a bill making its way through Congress that would impose tighter rules for transfers, and the fact that the 2016 elections might make lawmakers less likely to support housing detainees on U.S. soil. While those elements are beyond Pentagon control, Carter\u2019s stewardship of the detainee transfer process is certain to be closely watched by the White House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for action now,\u201d one official said. \u201cIt takes too long to tee up these opportunities [to] just cram it into the last three months of your presidency.\u201d\n\nJulie Tate contributed to this report."

      "source": "Two Haitian teenagers wearing surgical masks led us up a winding dirt road on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince to a freshly dug mass grave.\n\nA new mass grave for cholera victims, not far from mass grave site for last year's earthquake victims\n\nIt was long and narrow but deep, about the size and shape of a double-decker bus, and ready to receive bodies. The open pit is part of a massive mass grave, the only part not yet filled. A long rectangle of upturned earth, about half the length of a football field, marks where an unknown number of unknown people are already underground.\n\nThis grave is not for bodies still being pulled from the rubble after last year's earthquake in Haiti. Those are starting to blend in with the countryside, just over the hill in Titanyen. This spot is the final resting place the victims of Haiti\u2019s latest crisis: cholera.\n\nThose living nearby don\u2019t want it their backyard. Jean-Hubert Pierre\u2019s goats graze on this land. He fears for his health.\n\nJean-Hubert Pierre does not want this mass grave in his backyard. He fears it could make him and his family sick.\n\n\u201cI come here every day and I think smell, it\u2019s no good for me. It can affect my brain,\u201d he tells us.\n\nDue to fears like this, the Haitian government tries to keep the location of mass graves for Cholera secret. Once discovered by the locals, the graves are quickly filled in and a new one is dug somewhere else.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, more than 3,600 Haitians have died from Cholera since the first case was confirmed in October."

      "source": "Even worse was the stubborn insistence by social conservatives that policy riders defunding Planned Parenthood, NPR and the EPA be included in their list of demands until the 11th hour. These cuts were not about fiscal discipline, they were about social conservative litmus tests imposed to please the activist class.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is getting squeezed on both sides of his own caucus, trying to please social conservatives and the Tea Party crowd while also avoiding the massive popular backlash that would have accompanied a government shutdown. He is in the thankless position of being the responsible Republican in the room.\n\nThe $38 billion in cuts is the largest one-time dollar-for-dollar cut in American history, but still he gets no respect. Immediately after the compromise deal was announced, conservative congressmen and professional partisans were taking to Twitter to announce their disappointment, liberated by the absence of responsibility that comes with leadership.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann pronounced the results \"disappointing\" while Dick Morris' hot air reached Robespierre proportions, tweeting \"The budget deal is a total surrender by a gutless Speaker. Those who vote for it deserve a primary!!!\" Off with their heads!\n\nNo-drama Obama swooped in late to the negotiations, but was able to ultimately salvage a deal without getting strong-armed on social issues. Still, liberal activists like former Labor Secretary Robert Reich were unhappy as well, Tweeting, \"The Prez and Ds caved in, endangering the recovery and strengthening the right-wing bullies. A tactical win for the Prez and a strategic loss.\"\n\nIdeological inflexibility is not the same thing as political principle. Rooting for a government shutdown --especially over these comparatively small cuts and social issue riders -- is a sign of extremism and irresponsibility.\n\nIf the shutdown had occurred, they would have learned that the American people reject ideological extremism. Instead, many will be quick to play the government shutdown card as we head into a more serious round of negotiations about reducing the deficit and the debt.\n\nAmerica's strategic competitors like China must have watched our near self-sabotage with amusement over the past few days. Motivation through mutually assured destruction is no way to run a government. Politics in a democracy depends on the art of compromise, finding a way to reason together as fellow citizens. By viewing each other as ideological enemies we look foolish and weak, unable to muster the courage and unity necessary to deal with long-term challenges.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon."

So no Bill Clinton or Barack Obama seats, but OK to Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.\n\nRoss wound up at the Nixon table with another Trump supporter -- Ken Langone.\n\n\"When push comes to shove, they\u2019ll like her less than him,\" Langone said of a Hillary Clinton vs. Trump contest, adding that Bernie Sanders\u2019s appeal should be acknowledged too. \"He\u2019s got the kids, and that\u2019s something we have to wonder about,\" Langone said of the Vermont senator\u2019s support among millennials. \"What are the kids saying we need to do? It\u2019s up to every one of us to listen.\"\n\nRoss forecast Sanders will run as an independent. \u201cIn this weird election year, Sanders is going to be the wild card,\" Ross said. \"He\u2019s a movement, he\u2019s not just a person, and a movement needs momentum.\"\n\nThe room was filled with Democrats and Republicans, red and blue balloons, but also people unwilling to stump for a candidate.\n\n\"We deserve what we get,\" said Loews Corp. co-chairman Andrew Tisch, a co-founder of No Labels, a group that fights hyper-partisanship.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to vote,\" said architect Richard Meier.\n\n\"I can\u2019t wait for this election to be over,\" said Lauren Veronis, patriotically wearing a blue dress with red shoes and red lipstick. \"I\u2019m hoping the best person wins.\"\n\nVeronis has helmed this benefit for 34 years, longer than eight presidential terms -- making hers the reign of a queen, though Four Seasons co-owner Alex Von Bidder called her a first lady. Either way, she looked the part, waving to guests on the steps overlooking the dining room at the Four Seasons, holding a bouquet, a gift from her daughter, Perri Peltz.\n\nNot that she\u2019s succeeded as a party host by taking on royal airs. \"We always have a lot of fun,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously.\"\n\nThe different theme each year is part of the successful formula. Other hallmarks of the event are the location (the Four Seasons restaurant), the day of the week (Sunday) and the dress code (no black tie). The most special aspect, however, is how people get their food: walking through the kitchen to fill their plates at multiple buffet stations, which gives the event its name: the Through the Kitchen Party.\n\n\"Everybody likes to be an insider, and nothing can be more inside than being in the kitchen of a world-famous restaurant,\" said Ross.\n\nEva Dubin had sushi on her first pass, then came back for pasta -- \u201cFederalist fusilli.\u201d The menu also included \"Tippecanoe and oysters too,\" \"salmon ceVETOiche,\" and \"above the fruited plain chutney.\"\n\nAt the carving stations were \"short ballot ribs,\" \"Alexander Ham-ilton\" and \"lame duck.\" For dessert: \"yes we pe-can\" pie and a Dolley Madison ice cream sundae bar.\n\nThe tables, meanwhile, had plenty of hats, campaign buttons and other objects with an embedded history lesson. The baby doll was a reminder of the illegitimate child supported by Grover Cleveland. Because Zachary Taylor died after drinking milk, his table featured a ceramic cow labeled \"poison.\" Ronald Reagan\u2019s table had jelly beans.\n\nTable tributes, clockwise from top right, Grover Cleveland, George Washington, Harry Truman and Zachary Taylor\n\nDeJuan Stroud once again oversaw the decor, which also included an inflatable elephant, an inflatable donkey and bunting around the bar.\n\nAnd the party isn\u2019t just fun -- it\u2019s raised more than $15 million over the years for immunotherapy research, a pathway for beating cancer that was once a dream and is now yielding effective treatments.\n\nRoss lamented that it would be the last Through the Kitchen Party to be held at the Four Seasons restaurant, at least in the Modernist icon\u2019s current incarnation in the Seagram Building. The restaurant is moving out in July.\n\nDennis Basso, Perri Peltz and Caryn Zucker\n\n\"When I bought my business, my original office was right next door -- this was my lunch place,\" Ross said. \"I feel a part of me is vanishing.\"\n\nDuring the live auction, hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised for CRI\u2019s Irvington Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, including dinner for six at the Four Seasons wherever it relocates (a location has not been announced).\n\nPaula Root, Danielle and David Ganek\n\nThe event raised $1.2 million and drew 280 guests, among them Leonard Harlan (for Trump); Benjamin Rosen (a Hillary Clinton supporter); E. John Rosenwald; Larry Leeds; Christopher Harland; Charles Bronfman; David and Danielle Ganek; David Wassong, Tony Bennett; Tom Tuft and Diane Tuft; and Robin Hayes, chief executive of JetBlue, who donated a travel experience to the auction and sat with CRI\u2019s CEO, Jill O\u2019Donnell-Tormey."

Each of these shakedowns is a crime and that's why we're here today.\"\n\nBlagojevich defense attorney, Aaron Goldstein, told jurors his client is innocent because \"in the end (prosecutors) found nothing, because there is nothing... time after time you will be left with nothing.\"\n\nThe defense wants jurors to believe everything Blagojevich is accused of doing boils down to all talk and no action. \"He wasn't shaking down anyone. He was talking. What you will hear is him talk and talk and talk,\" Goldstein said during opening statements.\n\nThree men and 15 women make up the 12 jurors and six alternates who will hear the case over the next five weeks and decide if Blagojevich is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBlagojevich's first corruption trial ended in a hung jury on all 24 counts against him, except for one, lying to the FBI. This time around, the prosecutors have streamlined the case and dropped a few charges (wire fraud and racketeering) in an attempt to make it easier for jurors to follow the case."

      "source": "PARIS \u2014 For most of us, Paris is a stage; we expect a performance in the scenes of daily life, from the exquisite way a tiny child is dressed to the steam rising from soupe \u00e0 l\u2019oignon to statues of long-dead philosophers lit by the spotlight of a winter sun.\n\nBut since the Nov. 13 attacks \u2014 130 people murdered by the most hateful sect on earth \u2014 the metaphors of Paris have changed. It\u2019s a victim, we are told, poor, sad Paris. Under an extended state of emergency, \u201cParis is on wartime footing,\u201d as Foreign Policy magazine put it.\n\nDon\u2019t believe it. Yes, the city is wrapped in a blanket of added security, the seen and the unseen, the armed soldiers who appear suddenly around a street corner, the searches of bags and scanning by metal detectors at even the smallest of museums. Tourism was hit hard, as were retailers. Many small shopkeepers did not survive the weeks when Paris barely stirred.\n\nBut there is no siege mentality. Long ago, Paris was a walled city built around an island in the Seine. These days, of course, it belongs to the world. A visitor expecting to see a dimmed City of Light finds Parisians now defying its barbarous haters in the best way possible \u2014 graceful expressions of how to live well, with a shrug.\n\nA place where food is recognized by the United Nations as an \u201cintangible cultural heritage,\u201d a place that survived the darkest years of Nazi occupation and has felt the trepidation of terrorism for decades, will not stay down for long.\n\n\u201cI see it everywhere I go \u2014 the French are not going to give up the things that they love,\u201d Jane D. Hartley, the American ambassador to France, said in an interview. Hartley endured a trial by fire, arriving not long before the Charlie Hebdo attacks of January 2015 and then working through the painful days following the slaughter of innocents last November by killers linked to the Islamic State.\n\nHartley, the latest in a line of American representatives that includes Thomas Jefferson and Pamela Harriman, said she\u2019s been moved by the way the French have refused to cower or withdraw. Cafes are alive, if not packed. The streets are anything but empty.\n\nThe mass displays, when people crowded into public spaces to sing \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d and wave the tricolor, have given way to smaller acts of national pride. What stands out are the little things, acts of dignity and beauty \u2014 the politics of style.\n\nThe attacks were aimed at French values: enlightenment, sexuality, music, the human spirit without censor. And so, as Valentine\u2019s Day came and went, window displays of outr\u00e9 lingerie became a double entendre of sorts \u2014 a retail tease, of course, but also a statement that Frenchwomen will not cover up.\n\nIn the same vein, sipping wine in cafes along sidewalks \u2014 gasp, public displays of alcohol! \u2014 have taken on bit more significance in the weeks after people were gunned down while doing just that. As well, it\u2019s no small joy to sit at an open-air table when that air is 32 degrees and threatening snow.\n\nOver the years, people have always found inspiration in Paris during it bouts of depression and hard times. You think of Julia Child, in a cold postwar apartment, trying to learn how to cook coq au vin. Buying the chicken was the easy part. You think of Josephine Baker, who was at her flamboyant best singing \u201cParis Toujours,\u201d as a menace grew inside neighboring Germany.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring to see lines outside the Pompidou Center and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, waiting to get a look at brush strokes of bodies that Islamic fanatics find so threatening. And it\u2019s comforting to see tables of vin-quaffing diners debating issues large and small at Brasserie Lipp, where Hemingway worked on \u201cA Farewell to Arms.\u201d\n\nSome of those debates, no doubt, are about the wisdom of a state of emergency that allows the police to bang down doors, disrupt families, close mosques and cast a suspicious eye at anyone who prays to a God different from the one summoned inside the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. Because the terror attacks were done in the name of radical Islam, the faith of the majority who practice a peaceful version of that religion is suspect, by some.\n\nIt would be more reassuring if the police state campaign had yielded more than a handful of potential terror suspects. For now, it looks like Trumpism with an accent.\n\nFor all of that, a potential visitor who may doubt whether this city can still serve up its quintessential pleasures, even in late winter, should think again. Paris, as Audrey Hepburn said, is always a good idea. Even more so when the city is under some duress."

But the choices for 2015 also extend one of the biggest snubs in the hall\u2019s history: Chic, the 1970s disco-pop band founded by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards, has been turned down once again after nine times on the ballot \u2014 the institution\u2019s longest record of failed nominations.\n\nThe vote against Chic is only the latest manifestation of the Rock Hall\u2019s tortured dealings with the legacy of disco, a history that, after nearly four decades, still brings out territorial rivalries among critics and historians. After Donna Summer died in 2012, for example, Jon Landau, the chairman of the hall\u2019s nominating committee, took the unusual step of publicly rebuking the full voting assembly, saying that they had repeatedly \u201cfailed to recognize her\u201d; Ms. Summer was promptly inducted in 2013.\n\nThe time had finally seemed right for Chic, given Mr. Rodgers\u2019s extraordinary success lately, particularly the three Grammy Awards he won earlier this year as a collaborator on Daft Punk\u2019s album \u201cRandom Access Memories.\u201d (Mr. Edwards died in 1996.) There is no limit in the number of times an act can be nominated, so perhaps the fight can start all over again next year.\n\nA total of 15 acts had been nominated in October, and along with Chic, the others who did not make the cut are Kraftwerk, Nine Inch Nails, Sting, N.W.A, the Smiths, the Marvelettes, the Spinners and War. (Sting is already a member with the Police; Mr. Reed, who died last year, was already in with the Velvet Underground, and Mr. Starr had joined in 1988 as part of the Beatles.)\n\nThe inductees were chosen by a group of more than 700 artists, journalists and music executives. For a third year in a row, members of the public could also cast their votes online to be part of a single \u201cfans\u2019 ballot.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on 12/16/2014, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Lou Reed and Green Day Enter Rock Hall of Fame."

      "source": "Increasing consumer spending is crucial to accelerating the U.S. economy, and the survey data released Monday by Consumer Reports offered a glimmer of hope on that front. A weak one, perhaps, but a glimmer nonetheless.\n\nPurchases hit a two-year low, dragged down by significant drops in major home appliances and home electronics. Looking forward, however, the survey also found the highest intention to spend since last December. In fact, it was the first time in at least 2 1/2 years that respondents said they planned to spend more in the coming month than they'd spent in the previous month.\n\nThe Consumer Reports National Research Center has been checking consumers' attitudes every month since the height of the recession. At the end of October it asked 1,019 randomly selected people a series of questions aimed at gauging their sense of financial progress, their spending, their employment and their sources of financial stress.\n\nThe results have shown more volatility than the stock market. For example, the employment index, which compares the number of people who say they lost a job in the last 30 days to the number who say they found one, rose slowly from December to May, dropped back into negative territory in August, then posted small gains again in October and November.\n\n\"We're seeing a gradual improvement,\" said Ed Farrell, director of the research center. \"This is not recovery by any means.... We're nowhere near the numbers we need to get the millions and millions of folks back to work.\"\n\nThe survey's retail index, which gauges recent and planned purchases, has predictably risen as the Christmas season approached, then dropped sharply in the new year. This year's levels had generally been higher than last year's, but this month's score -- which reflects purchases in October -- was down sharply from last month and a year ago.\n\nThat might be cause for alarm if not for the aforementioned high reading for purchase intentions. Leading the way are personal electronics and major home electronics, which Farrell described as \"the big holiday items.\"\n\nStill, there's reason not to be too optimistic. The consumer sentiment index, which measures whether people feel better off than they did a year ago, has been slumping the last two months. Lower-income households (those earning less than $50,000 a year) have been pessimistic since the recession began, Farrell said; the troubling new trend is that sentiment in upper-income households (those earning more than $100,000) is heading south.\n\nOn balance, more upper-income households are still reporting that they feel better off than they did a year ago. But the margin is considerably slimmer than it was in January, Farrell said.\n\nBefore you say \"Cry me a river,\" consider that a household income of $100,000 does not a fat cat make. More important, spending by that group has been vital to what little growth the economy has mustered since the recession ended. \"When their sentiment starts to collapse,\" Farrell warned, \"that really has a major impact on retail.\"\n\nCash-rich China spurs capitalist-running-dog West\n\nDeficit: 100 votes for shared sacrifice"

In July, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that barring Filipinos from the shoal violated \u201ctraditional fishing rights\u201d \u2014 but the Chinese did not budge.\n\nMany foreign experts and diplomats believe China may ultimately build on Scarborough, potentially turning it into a military outpost, just as they have done in the nearby Spratly Archipelago.\n\nBut most believed China would wait until after this week\u2019s G20 meetings, or even after the U.S. presidential election, to make any move. The fact that new ships were reported the day before China\u2019s Xi Jinping had tea with President Obama in Hangzhou is therefore something of a surprise.\n\nIn Beijing on Monday, Hua, the spokeswoman, warned against seeing a message in the timing. \u201cWe hope the situation won\u2019t be hyped up,\u201d she said.\n\nChina, Philippines and the South China Sea ruling\n\nInternational tribunal rejects Beijing\u2019s claims to South China Sea\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world"

Out of Afghanistan, even if military commanders say a premature withdrawal imperils our gains. Avoid rattling the saber with Iran, even if Iran is emboldened and Israel is left feeling unsupported. Cut defense, even if Obama\u2019s own secretary of defense says the cuts are \u201cdevastating.\u201d Defer to the United Nations on Syria, even if Russia blocks action and the death toll mounts. Obama boasts that this is smart diplomacy and critics would lead us to war. But look where it has gotten us \u2014 two attacks, a several dead Americans and our ally Israel nervous as a cat.\n\nToday, Obama finally coughed up a slightly more resilient response, saying \u201cJustice will be done.\u201d Aside from cliches, his comments were rambling, hardly a sign of resolve. It, frankly, underscored how weak is this president\u2019s approach to national security. Even worse he echoed the condemnation of insulting religion, but gave no defense of free speech. And he took no questions. They might be impertinent.\n\nNo matter how hard he tries to rule out criticism as \u201cpartisan,\u201d this is the nub of the election and his presidency: Has he failed to lead? Is he not responsible for the safety of Americans abroad?\n\nMitt Romney in his remarks, by contrast, sounded forceful and resolute, including this:\n\nIf Romney wanted to sound more presidential than the president, he succeeded.\n\nRecall Obama has done nothing in the past when it comes to attacks on diplomats. We took no action following the attack on the embassy in Georgia or the Iranian plot to kill a Saudi diplomat on U.S. soil. I asked Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies for his take in how we got to the point where jihadists attack us with impunity, and Israel is pressed to the mat on Iran. He told me, \u201cThese attacks remind me of the assault on the Iranian embassy in 1979. Back then, we watched helplessly as our alliance with Iran crumbled in the wake of an Islamic revolution that our leaders assured us would not get out of hand. Things took a turn for the worse when a group of radicals besieged our embassy and held our personnel hostage for 444 days. While no hostages were taken last night, one gets a sense that the ties with Egypt are about to get a lot worse.\u201d\n\nHe observed that this was not a random mob but a planned assault, culminating with the \u201caffront of tearing down our flag and replacing it with the al-Qaeda flag on the anniversary of 9/11.\u201d He argued, \u201cThe inability or unwillingness of [Egyptian President Mohamed] Morsi\u2019s government to protect our embassy is also of deep concern, not to mention today\u2019s statement that falls far short of apologizing.\u201d\n\nFormer deputy national security advisor Elliott Abrams is more pointed:\n\nOur new \u201crelationship\u201d with the Muslim Brotherhood government even with (or because of) our rash release of aid without conditions is unraveling. And in Libya, Schanzer noted, the attack there is \u201cparticularly confounding. We led the way in liberating that country from Moammar Gaddafi. This is apparent repayment.\u201d\n\nAs for Israel, the White House insists it didn\u2019t turn down a request for a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel says it is lying, and a meeting was requested.\n\nSuch is the state of the U.S.-Israel relationship. The tussle over who requested what begs the question as to why the leaders aren\u2019t meeting in New York. If the relationship is as close as Obama insists, there would be every reason to meet, make a show of solidarity and make a joint statement regarding Iran. So Netanyahu resorts to heckling Obama in public over \u201cred lines.\u201d\n\nSchanzer said, \u201c The real problem here is the lack of transparency on the part of President Obama. When was the last time he delivered an official presidential statements on the Iranian nuclear crisis? He has not given the American people or the Israelis a glimpse of how he plans to tackle what has become the most pressing foreign policy issue of our time. This is what is driving Bibi to his wits end. \u201c\n\nSo how is that leading from behind, timidity in the face of jihadists, meekness toward Iran and heavy defense cut policy working out? Are we more safe or are events spinning out of control? Are we most respected or less? The answer: Romney is being unfair pointing all this out.\n\nMitt Romney certainly will be asked what he\u2019d do now. That is a legitimate line of inquiry and he should be prepared to say how he\u2019d readjust our relationship with Egypt, for example. But the real answer is that another president wouldn\u2019t have landed us in this spot. He\u2019d have shown resolve in Afghanistan. He\u2019d have acted with extreme caution and laid down some ground rules with the new Muslim Brotherhood government. He\u2019d have made the military option against Iran more real, and given Israel assurances about acting if Iran did not give up its nuclear weaponization.\n\nToday is significant because it is a dramatic demonstration of a failed approach to the world. Weakness invites attacks, disloyalty to allies encourages foes. And Obama has no right to insist he is beyond criticism. It would be interesting to start with some specifics: Did he attend his intelligence briefings this week, and what warning and/or instructions were issued to embassies?\n\nAs for the media trying to turn this into a Romney misstep, well sometimes they show off their bias and inanity a little too much. If they are going to insist that holding a president accountable for his national security is out of bounds, then perhaps journalism is now farce."

Smith also chairs the House Foreign Affairs Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee, where on Jan. 27, at a hearing about crises in Nigeria, he informed the principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs that he had a distinct definition of \"human rights.\"\n\n\"There are fundamental differences in the United States over the whole LGBT issue,\" said Smith to Robert Jackson, the deputy assistant secretary. \"I am a strong believer in traditional marriage, and do not construe 'homosexual rights' as 'human rights.'

This includes people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT).\"\n\nSmith wasn't quibbling with that. He disagreed with the definition, and worried that the policy of gay rights promotion, which began in 2011, might have been preventing the United States from working with less \"progressive\" Nigerian institutions. The Human Rights Campaign and other gay groups immediately condemned Smith, and noted that he said this the very same day that 12 Nigerians were arrested for attending a same-sex marriage.

While NASCAR officially owns each and every car number, the No. 21 will always truly belong to Wood Brothers Racing, one of NASCAR's founding families.\n\nYes, a dozen different drivers drove the No. 21 for a race or two from 1949-52, in the early days of NASCAR, but once Glen Wood first raced the No. 21 at Martinsville Speedway on May 17, 1953, a dynasty was born.\n\nAnd it took a while to take off. The first year the team was victorious in the NASCAR Premier Series was 1960, when Glen Wood won three times and Speedy Thompson twice more.\n\nFrom there, the team used some of the best drivers in NASCAR history, including NASCAR Hall of Famers David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, Junior Johnson, Dale Jarrett, Curtis Turner, Fred Lorenzen and Bill Elliott. Brothers Glen and Leonard Wood are NASCAR Hall of Fame members, too.\n\nOther famous drivers who piloted the Wood Brothers No. 21 included Dan Gurney, A.J. Foyt and Parnelli Jones.\n\nAt one time, the Wood Brothers team was one of the top two outfits in NASCAR, along with Petty Enterprises.\n\nFive times the Wood Brothers won the Daytona 500, the most famous coming in 1976, when Pearson and Richard Petty crashed together on the last lap. Pearson was able to coax his wounded No. 21 Mercury home to victory, while Petty's Dodge stalled in the infield and wouldn't re-fire.\n\nOne of the biggest upsets in sports history -- in all sports, not just NASCAR -- occurred in the 2011 Daytona 500 when rookie Trevor Bayne won the sport's biggest event in only his second career Sprint Cup start, one day after his 20th birthday. It was a remarkable and remarkably emotional triumph.\n\nLate in the 2015 season, brothers Eddie and Len Wood announced that in 2016, the team would return to full-time competition for the first time since 2008. It was good news for the Woods, good news for talented young driver Ryan Blaney and good news for Ford Motor Co., the only manufacturer the team has ever been affiliated with.\n\n\"To get them back on the track full time is the way it should be,\" said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance, during last month's Wood Brothers announcement. \"They have been our most loyal team for 65 years and they deserve the right to come out every weekend and prove what they can do. I think more than even deserved, they have earned it. They have been very strong this year and as a result of that we are committed to getting them on the track full time.\"\n\nThe No. 21 by the numbers:\n\nWins by driver: David Pearson, 43; Cale Yarborough, 13; Neil Bonnett, 9; Marvin Panch, 8; A.J. Foyt, 4; Speedy Thompson, 2; Harold Kite, 1; Elliott Sadler, 1; Morgan Shepherd, 1; Kyle Petty, 1; Dale Jarrett, 1; Buddy Baker, 1; Curtis Turner, 1; Glen Wood, 1; Donnie Allison, 1; Tiny Lund, 1; Tim Flock, 1; Trevor Bayne, 1.\n\nAll stats provided by driveraverages.com"

Bosley died in October.\n\nUnder their contracts, the actors were supposed to receive 5% of net proceeds, or 2 1/2% if their images were used in a group.\n\nIn exclusive interviews with CNN earlier this year, the four cast members said they decided to move forward after discovering \"Happy Days\" slot machines were popping up in casinos around the country in 2008.\n\n\"When these slot machines came out, it was like Barnum and Bailey came to town,\" Williams told CNN. \"We were bombarded with, oh look at these pictures, they'd be all over the country.\"\n\nThe actors said when they couldn't resolve their differences with CBS during mediation earlier this year, they decided to file suit.\n\nThe lawsuit says the show \"epitomizes what is best in America with the Cunningham family exemplifying the best of what a family can be. As will be proven at trial, defendants' actions epitomize what is worst in corporate America, exemplifying the worst business practices.\"\n\nIt claims that CBS \"adopted a 'don't ask, don't pay' policy. If you don't ask, then we don't pay.'\" The suit asks for $10 million in damages.\n\nHowever, CBS says there is no evidence of fraud, and the actors \"offer no basis for their vague allegation that defendants did not intend to pay merchandising royalties to plaintiffs at the time the parties entered into the agreements.\"\n\n\"Instead, all plaintiffs can allege is that defendants ultimately failed to pay,\" which is \"insufficient as a matter of law to show fraud.\"\n\nThe company disputed that it \"concealed\" its obligation to pay merchandising revenues. Instead, it said the actors \"were simply ignorant of, or slept upon their own rights. That cannot serve as a basis for a fraud claim.\"\n\nCBS said in a statement that the actors \"are owed royalties from the merchandising of 'Happy Days' and have, in fact, been working with their representatives for some time to see that they are paid what they are due.\"\n\nNeither Ron Howard, the Oscar-winning director who played Richie Cunningham, nor Henry Winkler, who played The Fonz, are part of the lawsuit.\n\nWinkler, who told CNN earlier this year that he supported the actors in their case, said he was paid for merchandising, including his image and voice on the slot machines. He would not say how much."

      "source": "She's a wife, mother and lawyer, an advocate for children and military families, and first lady of the United States. Now Michelle Obama has added a new gig: magazine editor.\n\nThe first lady is ``guest editor'' of the July-August issue of More, which bills itself as the magazine for ``women of style and substance.''\n\nIt was a first for both the White House and the magazine industry, said Lesley Jane Seymour, More's editor-in-chief.\n\n``There's never been a first lady who's ever guest-edited a magazine and certainly not a sitting first lady,'' Seymour told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"She's really the editor,'' Seymour said. She said the edition focuses on Mrs. Obama's ``point of view on the world and it's from her eyes.''\n\n``Guest editor'' wasn't just a fancy title. The first lady had to pitch story ideas and write and approve copy for the 148-page issue, Seymour said.\n\nShe ``was reading every page and asking for changes up until the last minute,'' Seymour said. ``She had to approve absolutely everything. She had to suggest various things, too.'' Staff handled stories about fashion and beauty, along with basic functions of the magazine.\n\nThe theme of the issue is having ``More Impact.''\n\nMrs. Obama said she welcomed the opportunity to share some of her White House experiences with like-minded readers.\n\n``What I want readers to understand is that impact comes in all forms, shapes and sizes. And hopefully through this issue, what people will see is that you can have impact as a military mom changing careers, or you can be a young person starting a business or you can be the first lady and start a whole initiative,'' Mrs. Obama said in a written statement released by More.\n\nThe issue highlights the first lady's four priorities: helping children live healthier lives, supporting military families, encouraging young people to pursue education past high school and helping girls around the world attend and stay in school. It also includes pieces on her long-serving chief of staff and senior adviser, two women who have influenced the first lady's work.\n\nMrs. Obama wrote a brief review of ``The Light of the World,'' a memoir that Obama friend Elizabeth Alexander wrote after her husband's sudden death three years ago. The first lady says the book ``simply took my breath away.'' In January 2009, Alexander wrote and delivered a poem at President Barack Obama's inauguration.\n\nThe first lady's byline appears on a reflective piece about the reaction after she said her top priority is being ``mom in chief'' to daughters Malia and Sasha.\n\nShe also reveals the music on her ``chill-out'' playlist, including songs by Beyonce, Stevie Wonder and the duo of Tony Bennett and Lada Gaga.\n\nAnd in a separate feature, Mrs. Obama reveals the stories behind some of her favorite photographs, including of her and her daughters walking along the Great Wall in China during a weeklong trip there last year and a photo of the Obama family on the steps of their Chicago home ``before our new life was about to kick off.''\n\nOther photos show Malia sledding on the White House grounds during a 2009 snowstorm, using lunch trays borrowed from the White House mess, and the new president and first lady in a golf cart as they are driven from one inaugural ball to the next inside Washington's cavernous convention center in 2009.\n\n``What most people don't realize is that there is not one inaugural ball but 10 separate events,'' Mrs. Obama wrote. ``So we would walk out, our song would play, we would dance, and then we would move to a freight elevator on our way to the next ball. There were quite a few held all over the convention center. To save my feet, they had a golf cart to shuttle us.''\n\nThe first lady was not compensated for her work, Seymour said.\n\nWith the issue, due on newsstands on June 23, Mrs. Obama also makes her third appearance on More's cover."

      "source": "Despite being considered by some as a hospital of last resort, the sprawling city hospital where I\u2019ve spent 20 years is at the forefront of electronic trends. Although some hospitals are computerized, most do not have fully functional electronic medical records, as promoted by the health care reform law of 2010. And more than half of all outpatient practices still use paper charts, making health care the only major industry that is not fully computerized.\n\nBut in this inner-city hospital, sleek flat screens sit in every one of the nearly 500 outpatient clinic rooms and nurses\u2019 offices. The inpatient wards are veritable hubs of hardware and wireless technology. Every M.R.I. scan, X-ray, CT scan and EKG can be viewed by any doctor anywhere in the hospital. Prescriptions can be renewed in seconds. Medication interactions are automatically flagged. Lab results are queued to the individual doctor. Immunizations can be tracked. One click brings up a patient\u2019s blood pressure readings for the past decade. Doctors can be reminded to ask about smoking, depression, domestic violence and asthma.\n\nIn this heroic pursuit of the \u201cpaperless chart,\u201d the hospital often seems a bit like the 21st century equivalent of the 1950s secretarial pool: doctor after doctor hunched over the desk, dutifully pounding away at their keyboards. Nurses, respiratory technicians, nutritionists and pharmacists are glued to their computers. Mobile computer carts fill the hallways for doctors to review X-rays or order stat medications while on rounds.\n\nRampant carpal tunnel syndrome notwithstanding, this new system clearly has advantages: no more chicken scrawl on the charts, or hieroglyphics on prescriptions. No more hunting down lost charts in the bowels of Medical Records. No more EKGs crumpled away in some intern\u2019s back pocket. No more X-rays lost in surgery clinic.\n\nBut the presence of computers in the exam room has had another consequence. Both physically and psychologically it has placed a wedge in the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nIn the old days, when a patient arrived in my office, I laid the paper chart on the desk between us. I looked directly at the patient. As we spoke, I would briefly drop my eyes to jot a note on the page, and then look right up to continue our conversation. My gaze and my body language remained oriented toward the patient nearly all the time. In the current computerized medical world this is impossible. I have to be tuned toward the computer screen to check labs, review X-rays, read prior notes, document the patient\u2019s current concerns.\n\nLike most internists, I know that the interview is the most important part of a patient visit. It always yields far more information than the physical exam, which, in many ways, is an afterthought.\n\nBut now that the computer is impeding the intimacy normally achieved during the talking part of the visit, I find that I rely on the physical exam more. Once the patient and I have broken free from confines of the desk, with its dictatorial PC, we have a more comfortable realm, that of touch. As soon as there is skin-to-skin connection, conversation flows more easily. In the absence of a machine lodged between us, the traditional doctor-patient relationship is restored.\n\nStill, after the physical exam, when we return to the desk to wrap up the visit, we are stuck back with the computer screen between us as I print out prescriptions, order labs and document all the elements of our visit in order to comply with the vast and ever-expanding charting requirements. The clicking of the keyboard interrupts our conversation, and there are uncomfortable periods of silence as the patient waits for me to scroll through the seemingly endless number of screens in order to close the visit.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a pretty sight: the profile of the doctor squinting at the screen, hands endlessly back and forth between mouse and keyboard, invariably muttering mild expletives as accidental strokes cause data to disappear and printers to jam. However, there is no practical way to keep up with the flow of work and the backlog of other patients waiting.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. The computer has much to offer, but I mourn the loss of intimacy that it has engendered. For the longest time, the ophthalmologists in our hospital resisted the electronic medical record. Perhaps they were too used to drawing diagrams in their notes, or maybe they were just lazy Luddites. But whenever I clicked on their notes to see what happened to my patient during their recent visit to the eye doctor, I would invariably see this neatly typed, succinct summary: \u201cSee paper chart.\u201d\n\nBut in the era of the paperless chart, no such actual chart would ever show up, so that computerized note may as well have said: \u201cPlease read my mind.\u201d\n\nAnd then I would need to ask the patient what happened when they went to the eye doctor. Luckily, this would give us a chance to talk again.\n\nis associate professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and editor-in-chief of the\n\n. Her most recent book is"

Putin\u2019s behavior in Ukraine.\n\nPublish Date April 28, 2014\n\nCredit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States on Monday imposed additional sanctions against Russian government officials, businessmen and companies deemed close to President Vladimir V. Putin, accusing Moscow of failing to live up to its agreement to defuse the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThe Obama administration ordered travel bans and asset freezes for seven Russian individuals, including two said to be in Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle, and froze assets for 17 companies. Thirteen Russian companies will face additional restrictions as the government will cut off the export or re-export of American-made products to them.\n\nAdditionally, the State and Commerce Departments announced a new policy to deny export license applications for high-technology items that could contribute to Russia\u2019s military capabilities. The two departments will revoke existing export licenses along those lines, the White House said in a statement. The European Union plans to follow with sanctions on 15 Russians, officials said.\n\nAmong those targeted on Monday was Igor I. Sechin, president of the state-owned Rosneft oil company and a longtime Putin adviser. Although administration officials said over the weekend that they also expected Aleksei B. Miller, the head of the energy giant Gazprom, to be targeted, Mr. Obama ultimately chose a list that did not include him.\n\nRussia supplies about one-third of the oil and gas imported into the European Union, a dependency that complicates efforts to punish Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. European leaders continue to consider a range of economic sanctions, including measures against the oil and gas industries.\n\nSquare size represents the total energy imports into each country (excluding intra-E.U. trade).\n\nSquare size represents the total energy imports into each country (excluding intra-E.U. trade).\n\nOthers who face sanctions include Dmitri N. Kozak, a deputy prime minister; Vyacheslav V. Volodin, a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Putin; and Aleksei Pushkov, the chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament. The companies targeted included several banks, including Sobinbank, and energy companies like the Stroytransgaz Group and various related entities.\n\nStroytransgaz and its related companies form the pipeline construction arm of Gazprom that maintains and expands the Russian domestic natural gas pipeline network, the world\u2019s largest gas pipeline system, and for years the companies have been the focus of suspicion by financial analysts that they are used to siphon money from Gazprom to insiders. Gazprom\u2019s capital expenditures totaled about $24.4 billion in 2013, according to a company statement. The Stroytransgaz companies were initially affiliated with the 1990s-era management of Gazprom, but later shifted to the control of longtime associates of Mr. Putin, including the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.\n\nIn imposing sanctions on Mr. Sechin, the administration has targeted a top partner of ExxonMobil, which has multiple joint ventures with Rosneft. It is not known if Mr. Sechin has any assets in the United States to freeze, but he will no longer be permitted into the country to consult with his ExxonMobil partners. ExxonMobil lawyers have been studying the possible ramifications in anticipation of the administration move, but a company spokesman said Monday that it had no comment.\n\nThe firms targeted on Monday were all tied to Russian businessmen who were targeted in previous rounds of sanctions. Eleven of the companies were linked to Gennady N. Timchenko, including the Volga Group, his private investment holding company. Mr. Timchenko is a co-founder of the Gunvor Group, a commodities trading firm in which the Treasury Department has previously said Mr. Putin has personal investments. Gunvor has adamantly denied that Mr. Putin has any financial ties to the company, and Mr. Timchenko has sold his shares in Gunvor.\n\nThree other firms targeted on Monday were tied to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg: InvestCapitalBank, SMP Bank and Stroygazmontazh. Three others were subsidiaries of Yuri V. Kovalchuk\u2019s Bank Rossyia: Abros, Zest and Sobinbank.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s targeted sanctions, taken in close coordination with the E.U., will increase the impact we have already begun to see on Russia\u2019s own economy as a result of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and from U.S. and international sanctions,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement. \u201cRussian economic growth forecasts have dropped sharply, capital flight has accelerated and higher borrowing costs reflect declining confidence in the market outlook.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials said that the European sanctions list would diverge from theirs, but that the fact that both sides were moving on the same day signaled important unity.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect there to be an immediate change in Russian policy,\u201d said a senior administration official, briefing reporters under ground rules that did not permit him to be identified. But he said the latest actions would signal that \u201cmuch more severe economic pain\u201d could still be imposed if Moscow did not back down.\n\nOther individuals subject to the travel ban and asset freeze were Oleg Belavantsev, who was appointed by Mr. Putin last month as presidential envoy overseeing the annexed Crimean Peninsula; Sergei V. Chemezov, the director general of Rostec, the Russian state firm overseeing high-technology industries and a longtime member of Mr. Putin\u2019s circle; and Evgeny Murov, the director of Russia\u2019s Federal Protective Service and an army general.\n\nMr. Chemezov has had extensive dealings with Boeing through a joint venture part-owned by Rostec that manufactures about half of all titanium parts used in Boeing aircraft, and as a buyer of airplanes for a regional airline affiliated with Rostec\n\nThat the sanctions covered no large publicly listed Russian companies came as a relief to traders in Moscow. Around midday, Russia\u2019s benchmark Micex index recovered an initial loss after Mr. Obama said the list would not extend to the banking sector, and it closed with a modest gain of 1.5 percent. \u201cIt looked to be on the light side\u201d of what the markets expected, said one banker in Moscow, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThis was more of a reminder that a new phase of sanctions is possible.\u201d\n\nThe actions came shortly after President Obama, traveling here in Asia, declared that Russia was continuing to bully and threaten Ukraine and would pay a price. The fact that the announcement was made on the last stop of his weeklong Asia trip underscored the sense of urgency about fears that Russia was destabilizing eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions represent the next stage in a calibrated effort to change Russia\u2019s behavior,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference with President Benigno S. Aquino III of the Philippines.\n\nBut Mr. Obama acknowledged, \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know whether it is going to work,\u201d and he left the door open to more sweeping sanctions against Russian industries like banking and defense.\n\n\u201cThe goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not just talk the talk\u201d when it comes to diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, Mr. Obama said.\n\nMr. Obama said the sanctions would affect high-tech military exports to Russia, because they are not \u201cappropriate to be transferred in the current environment.\u201d\n\nIn remarks on Monday in Russia, Mr. Putin did not address the announcement from Mr. Obama directly. But he did say that the West wanted to try to target Russian military industries with sanctions primarily to undermine Moscow\u2019s attempts to replace critical military components that have long been produced in Ukraine.\n\nRussia would be able to replace all the imports within 18 months to two and a half years, Mr. Putin told lawmakers in the northwestern town of Petrozavodsk, in remarks broadcast live on television. Substitutions would \u201cnot require a review of the defense budget,\u201d he said.\n\nImports from Ukraine have slowed, but not stopped, Mr. Putin said, adding that he hoped they would continue. If not, the specialists working in defense plants are welcome to immigrate, he said.\n\nPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Mark Landler from Manila. Neil MacFarquhar and Andrew E.

Because you don\u2019t want people to think an election is over.\u201d\n\nBenenson was one of several election officials and political pundits to speak on a panel about the US election results.\n\n\u201c[Forecasting] is not news,\u201d he continued, \u201cit is not journalism and it is not news, and yet journalism is now obsessed with it because it is cheap news. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I can throw out polls.\u2019 They don\u2019t even discriminate [which polls they choose].\n\n\u201cThat is a terrible thing inside a campaign, for people to think that that election was won. Hated inside a campaign.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between people thinking Hillary is three points ahead in the polls, and someone who they think is a god of probability forecasting, saying there is a 94% chance she is winning. Maybe they say, \u2018I will have another drink at the bar and not vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nBenenson also pointed to a lack of trust in American institutions, which he blamed on the fallout of the economic crisis, and said Trump\u2019s role as a \u201cquintessential outsider\u201d helped the incoming Republican president.\n\nOther factors claimed as reasons for Clinton\u2019s defeat include an alleged failure by the campaign to ensure the support of Hispanic voters. Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC), told the Guardian on Saturday that after Trump built his campaign on hardline immigration policies, \u201cwe thought this election cycle would be different\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Palomarez said, \u201cHillary Clinton was advised once again by Beltway advisers who knew it all, had the models and the projections, but who called it wrong.\u201d\n\nBenenson echoed Clinton, who reportedly told donors in a private conversation that she blamed actions by Comey for her defeat, by pointing a finger at the FBI director, saying Comey\u2019s decision to announce the discovery of new alleged evidence in the FBI\u2019s investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server 11 days before the election \u201cdid have an effect\u201d.\n\nBenenson said voters who were on the fence about Clinton and contemplating support of third-party candidates, including Green party candidate Jill Stein, had begun coalescing around Clinton in the last weeks of the election, until the Comey letter went public.\n\n\u201cWe always had a group that were Trump defectors and a group that were Clinton defectors,\u201d Benenson said.\n\nFirst, Trump\u2019s defectors began to come back around to the Republican candidate, he said. \u201cAnd then our defectors started to come home until that Friday, and once that Friday hit, we saw them [go back] to the third-party candidates,\u201d Benenson said.\n\nComey sent a second letter two days before the election, saying no new evidence of wrongdoing had been found.\n\nBenenson said the trend of voters switching allegiance after Comey\u2019s first letter was \u201csignificant\u201d in Florida and in Wisconsin, where Stein garnered strong support among liberals and where Clinton lost by one point."

      "source": "It turns out those much-mocked Ice Bucket Challenge videos helped do a lot of good.\n\nTwo summers ago, the challenge, designed to raise money for research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, took the internet by storm. Supporters ended up raising over $115 million for the A.L.S. Association.\n\nOver two years, money from the challenge has helped fund the research and development of treatment drugs and has been used as prize money to entice people to design technology for people living with the disease, which causes a rapid breakdown in a person\u2019s ability to control muscle movement.\n\nThe association released a chart last year showing where the funds went:\n\n\u2022 $77 million, or 67 percent, went to research.\n\n\u2022 $23 million, or 20 percent, went to patient and community services.\n\n\u2022 $10 million, or 9 percent, went to public and professional education.\n\n\u2022 $3 million, or 2 percent, went to fund-raising.\n\n\u2022 And $2 million, roughly another 2 percent, went to payment processing fees.\n\nThe latest development, announced by the association this week, falls into the research category: It\u2019s the discovery of NEK1, which scientists say is among the most common genes that contribute to the disease and is associated with 3 percent of A.L.S. cases. The discovery, published in Nature Genetics, is the result of a global gene-sequencing effort involving 11 countries and 80 researchers, called Project MinE.\n\nThe challenge money allowed the association to invest $1 million in Project MinE, and \u201cinitiated the U.S. arm of this international effort,\u201d Carrie Munk, a spokeswoman for the association, said.\n\nThe discovery of NEK1 is significant but is not a breakthrough \u2014 some 30 genes tied to the disease have already been identified \u2014 according to Brian Frederick, executive vice president for communications and development for the A.L.S. Association.\n\nMr. Frederick said that the discovery of the gene could eventually mean that \u201ctreatments won\u2019t be limited to one subset of people with A.L.S., but that it might be a more broad group.\u201d\n\nThe movement took the internet by storm in July 2014, and many supporters trace the tipping point to a video posted by Pete Frates, a former college baseball player who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012. Others followed suit, including celebrities from Mark Zuckerberg to Lena Dunham, who consented to having a bucket of water dumped over their heads for a good cause.\n\nThe challenge spread as wildly as it did because the premise involved people reaching out to each other on social media with a simple request: Film yourself getting water dumped over your head or donate money to A.L.S. research. Many did both, but critics disparaged the movement as \u201cslacktivism\u201d or an outright racket. A.L.S. awareness activists, however, say that the challenge reinvigorated a research community that was lacking attention and funds to produce scientific advancements.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an excitement and an energy in the A.L.S. research community that has not been there before,\u201d Mr. Frederick said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of hope and optimism among many people living with A.L.S. now.\u201d"

      "source": "FORT MEADE, Md. \u2014 A Saudi man accused of plotting the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole walked into a military courtroom at the naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, on Wednesday morning, appearing in public for the first time since his capture nine years ago.\n\nThe arraignment of the defendant, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, marked the beginning of the highest profile military commission trial since the Bush administration created the system after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Nashiri, an accused Al Qaeda leader, could be executed if he is convicted, in what would be a first for the Guant\u00e1namo tribunals.\n\nMr. Nashiri was dressed in a short-sleeved white garb. He had short black hair and was clean-shaven. He sat slightly slouched, wearing earphones. In early interactions with the judge, he smiled several times and stroked his chin as the judge walked him through whether he understood that he had a right to legal representation and that he needed a translator.\n\nMr. Nashiri put off pleading guilty or not guilty to a series of charges against him \u2014 including murder in violation of the laws of war and conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism \u2014 related to the Cole bombing, a plot to attack another American warship and an attack against a French supertanker.\n\nMr. Nashiri also said that at present the lawyers assigned to him \u201care doing a good job\u201d and that he understood that he could change them in the future if he wanted. After mispronouncing the name of one of his lawyers, causing momentary confusion, Mr. Nashiri told the judge that \u201cI do not pronounce the names perfectly,\u201d to which the judge replied \u201cNeither do I.\u201d\n\nThe military, which is trying to showcase its reforms to the tribunals system, broadcast a live feed of the proceedings to a theater here on the Army base at Fort Meade, Md.\n\nThe bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, as it was moored in a harbor off Aden, Yemen, killed 17 sailors.\n\nMr. Nashiri\u2019s case is being closely watched. His is the first new case to move forward under President Obama, who shut down the Bush administration\u2019s tribunals in one of his first acts after taking office.\n\nHe is also the first \u201chigh-value\u201d detainee \u2014 a senior terrorism suspect who was held for a time by the C.I.A. at a \u201cblack site\u201d prison and subjected to what the agency called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d \u2014 to receive a trial at Guant\u00e1namo. For that reason, his case is also seen as a forerunner to the planned prosecution of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other accused conspirators in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAnother former high-value C.I.A. prisoner, Ahmed Ghailani, was transferred from Guant\u00e1namo to the civilian criminal justice system and prosecuted last year in New York for his role in Al Qaeda\u2019s 1998 bombings of embassies in Africa. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, but because a jury acquitted him of 284 of the charges against him, the venue for his case fueled controversy among Republicans who said the regular court system was too risky for terrorism cases.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s revival of military commissions, by contrast, has fueled controversy among civil-liberties and human rights groups. While the administration and Congress overhauled the system in 2009 to provide greater due-process protections to defendants, its critics say that it remains inherently illegitimate.\n\nThe tribunal could require the military system to confront whether it makes a difference that Mr. Nashiri was abused in custody; in addition to being one of three detainees subjected to the suffocation technique called waterboarding, which was approved by Bush administration lawyers, the C.I.A. inspector general called his the \u201cmost significant\u201d case of a detainee who was brutalized in ways that went beyond the Bush administration\u2019s approved tactics.\n\nAmong other things, the inspector general said, Mr. Nashiri\u2019s interrogators threatened him with a power drill in a mock execution. Defense lawyers are expected to try to bring up such treatment in the trial, while prosecutors are expected to say that it is irrelevant so long as they do not try to introduce his statements in custody as evidence.\n\nThe trial is also expected to raise several unresolved legal questions about jurisdiction and the rules of evidence in trials. Among the potential issues is whether it is valid to charge someone for a \u201cwar crime\u201d for an act that was taken before Congress essentially declared the United States to be at war with Al Qaeda; the government now contends that the state of war had existed since 1996, when Al Qaeda\u2019s leader, Osama Bin Laden, declared war against the United States.\n\nIt could also test the legality of tribunal rules that allow greater flexibility than in the traditional criminal justice system for prosecutors to introduce \u201chearsay\u201d evidence \u2014 testimony about statements and other evidence collected outside of the courtroom, giving the defendant no opportunity to cross-examine the person who provided them.\n\nImportant witnesses against Mr. Nashiri are not available to testify in the court, so prosecutors may call F.B.I. agents and others to relay what the witnesses are reported to have said about him. It remains unclear whether the Supreme Court would uphold any conviction that relied upon such evidence.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Nashiri, Rick Kammen, hinted at the defense\u2019s strategy: during the trial, the defense will likely attack the evidence against Mr. Nashiri as unreliable because it is hearsay and circumstantial. And if Mr. Nashiri is convicted, the defense will likely contend that he should not be sentenced to death because of the mitigating factor that he was \u201ctortured.\u201d\n\nMr. Kammen foreshadowed that strategy in a series of questions he posed to the Army judge, Col. James L. Pohl, about his views on the fairness of the military commission system rules and about the treatment of Mr. Nashiri while in custody. Colonel Pohl, however, declined to engage about his own views, saying he will apply the rules as he received them \u2014 from the Military Commissions Act of 2009 and a Pentagon regulation implementing it \u2014 regardless of what he personally thinks.\n\nColonel Pohl also declined a motion by the defense to force the prosecutors to say that if Mr. Nashiri were acquitted, the government would continue to detain him at Guant\u00e1namo rather than releasing him. Mr. Kammen had argued that if Mr. Nashiri is indeed unlikely ever to leave the prison, there is less of a reason to prevent him from seeing certain potentially classified evidence during the discovery phase."

      "source": "Americans are serial snackers. In fact, researchers say snacks account for an extra 580 extra calories per day in our diets.\n\nWe love snacks so much, in fact, that more than half the country uses them as a meal replacement, according to a recent Nielsen report\u2014and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Healthy snacks\u2014especially high-protein, afternoon munchies\u2014can curb appetite, improve diet quality and speed up weight loss, recent studies suggest. But the wrong snacks can pack on the pounds faster than you can rip open a bag of chips. And there\u2019s the rub.\n\nFinding a good-for-you mini-meal isn\u2019t easy because, in the American food jungle, chips are the most popular snack food (followed by chocolate, cheese and cookies). So simply the selection process, here\u2019s a list of the worst \u201chealthy\u201d snacks for weight loss, and the damage control tips you need to stay on track:\n\nRice cakes are an old-school diet staple. But the simple carbohydrates rank notoriously high on the glycemic index (GI) \u2014 a measure of how quickly blood rises in response to food on a scale of one to 100 (rice cakes come in at 82). High GI foods provide a rush of energy, but can leave you hungry within a few hours. Researchers at the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center found high-GI snacks caused excessive hunger and increased activity in craving and reward area of the brain\u2014the perfect storm for overeating and weight gain.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: Adding healthy fats or protein to a meal lowers its glycemic load. Swap a two cake mini-meal for one rice cake topped with a generous swipe of nut butter. The combo will keep you fuller for longer and has the added benefit of being a complete protein with all nine essential amino acids.\n\nSurely a few chocolate chips will satisfy your sweet tooth, right? Researchers aren\u2019t so confident; people consume an average 41% more calories when snacking on unwrapped snacks, one study published in the journal Appetite showed. Researchers say peeling off a wrapper, or cracking the shell of a nut slows us down, which gives the body more time to send out \u201cI\u2019m full\u201d signals. And the mounting pile of candy wrappers and nut shells serves as a visual reminder as to just how much we\u2019ve eaten.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: Remember that \u201cjust a bite\u201d still has calories, and we usually don\u2019t stop at just one bite. While high-quality dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa) is the most waist-friendly choco choice, you may want to stick with a small portion of wrapped varieties over \u201chand to mouth\u201d chocolate chips.\n\nSure, roasted nuts are delicious. But the high-heat cooking method does nut\u2019n for your waistline. Raw almonds caused stomach acids to swell (in a good way) and were slower digesting than roasted almonds, creating a greater feeling of fullness that lasted longer, one study in the journal Food Biophysics showed. Moreover, store-bought varieties are often roasted in oil and then tossed in salt and preservatives. Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Almonds may be oil-free, but you\u2019ll find 18 other ingredients on the label, including monosodium glutamate (MSG), a controversial flavor enhancer linked to weight gain in some studies.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: Go raw or go home. Brownie points if you opt for in-shell varieties. Named \u201cThe Pistachio Effect,\u201d research shows the act of shelling nuts can slow you down and give your body a chance to register fullness 86 calories sooner than you would otherwise.\n\nFor some people, eating gluten-free is a necessity. But for those who think \u201cgluten-free\u201d means weight loss-friendly, beware the health halo. A pretzel offers very little in the nutrition department\u2014gluten-free, organic, or otherwise\u2014and it\u2019s easy to fall for the claims. In a recent study, people estimated snacks labeled \u201corganic\u201d to be lower in calories, more nutritious and even tastier than when reviewing the same snacks without the \u201corganic\u201d label. Moreover, processed gluten-free snacks are typically higher in carbohydrates and fats than regular varieties. Gluten-free Glutino pretzels, for example, have an additional 30 calories, five grams of fat and none of the fiber and protein of an equivalent portion of regular Rold Gold variety.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: Don\u2019t get it twisted: Pretzels are little more than flour and salt. Satisfy your salty, crunchy craving with a big bowl of air-popped popcorn instead. Three cups of the naturally gluten-free snack clock in at only 90 calories and count as a serving of waist-whittling whole grains.\n\nReaching for a portion-controlled packet of crackers or cookies may sound like a good snack strategy for weight loss, but the mini-packs may fill you out before they fill you up, research suggests. In fact, dieters perceived small snacks in small packages as diet-friendly and ended up eating multiple packets and more calories overall than when given a regular-size package, a recent study in the Journal of Consumer Research found.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: When dieting, you\u2019re better off serving yourself a small portion from a regular-sized bag than falling for the allure of a minipack, study authors suggest.\n\nA fruit smoothie sounds like a virtuous choice for an afternoon pick-me-up, but be forewarned: Many store-bought options are blended with high-calorie dairy bases and cheap sweeteners that make them more dessert-like than diet-friendly. A small Baskin Robbins Mango Banana Smoothie packs 440 calories, nearly a third of what the average woman on a 1500-calorie weight loss diet needs in an entire day. Not to mention 96 grams of sugar\u2014that\u2019s more than you\u2019ll find in 7 scoops of the chain\u2019s Rainbow Sherbet. Adding insult to injury, banana doesn\u2019t feature once on the ingredients list.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: If you\u2019re hankering for something sweet and fruity, nothing beats a whole piece (or two!) of the real thing. In fact, a recent study in the journal Nature found liquid carbohydrates to be 17 percent less filling compared with solid carbohydrates. As a general rule: eat, don\u2019t drink, your fruits. And if it\u2019s creamy that you\u2019re craving, pair your fruit with a cup of low-fat plain cottage cheese or yogurt. A recent study found high-protein snacks eaten in the afternoon can improve appetite control and diet quality.\n\nWhat happens when you take a bowl of oats, drown them in oil, cover them with sugar, bake them on a cookie tray? You get your average granola: highly delicious, highly caloric, highly likely to put you over your daily calorie budget in just one serving \u2014 and chances are you\u2019ll munch through far more than a scant half-cup that makes up a single serving. In fact, a recent study found people served themselves the same volume of cereal regardless of caloric value. In other words, you\u2019re likely to pour the same amount of granola into a bowl as you would corn flakes, and consume five times the calories in the process.\n\nEAT THIS TIP: A big bowl of oatmeal topped with fresh fruit will fill you up for a fraction of the calories and fat as a small portion of energy-dense granola. In fact, a recent study found oatmeal to be the most satisfying breakfast in the cereal aisle\u2014leading to greater and longer lasting feelings of fullness than ready-to-eat cereal.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eat This, Not That!\n\nMore from Eat This, Not That!"

      "source": "Kemp was whistling in a hurricane.\n\nThe bad idea, advanced by Kemp with fanatical energy and devotion, was supply-side economics \u2014 \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d as George H.W. Bush so famously and rightly derided it. Supply-siders saw tax cuts as the answer to every prayer. Cut taxes, they argued, and watch the economy take off like a rocket.\n\nWhat they never spelled out for the electorate was that most of the tax cuts would go to the rich, that the rich would harvest most of the money from the increased economic activity, and that the radically reduced tax revenue would send government budget deficits streaking toward the moon.\n\nKemp professed not to be worried about the deficits. He seemed to have believed that somehow everything would work out. The ultramilitants to his right, people even further out in their orthodoxy than Kemp, were delighted by the deficits. They wanted to \u201cstarve the beast,\u201d reduce the government\u2019s revenues to the point where elected officials would have no choice but to cut programs and services that benefited people who were not rich. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were primary targets.\n\n\u201cOur goal,\u201d said Grover Norquist, \u201cis to shrink government down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\u201d\n\nNorquist, a driving force behind the George W. Bush tax cuts, once called John McCain a \u201ctax-increasing Bolshevik.\u201d We are talking about weirdness of a very high order here, and that weirdness dominated the economic policies of the United States for years.\n\nWorking people were told they should sign onto this craziness because the economic benefits of supply-side tax policies would ultimately benefit everyone. As every scheme imaginable was developed to bolster the fortunes of the rich, ordinary people were left in the humiliating position of waiting for some of the goodies to trickle down to them.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen how it all worked out.\n\nThe way to look at the endless theoretical and intellectual posturing of the right is to look at who actually does well when the so-called conservative policies are implemented, and who doesn\u2019t. Inevitably it\u2019s the rich who benefit.\n\nJack Kemp meant well, but the great irony that cloaked his entire career was that it was not possible to achieve the ends he sought using the means he pushed with such zeal. He wanted to help the middle class and the poor. He wanted the nation\u2019s inner cities to thrive, and he wanted America\u2019s prosperity to be broadly shared.\n\nBut he chose as his vehicle the party of the rich. The changes he advocated and helped shepherd into law went far beyond correcting excesses in the tax code. They radically transformed the economic system in ways that proved a boon to those who were already wealthy, were harmful to the very people he wanted to help and eventually left the overall economy in ruins.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s column, I mistakenly referred to Jim DeMint as the governor of South Carolina. He is a U.S. senator.\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on , on Page A27 of the National edition with the headline: Jack Kemp\u2019s Futile Quest. Today's Paper|Subscribe"

      "source": "Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at Tufts University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nJeb Bush continues to gear up for a presidential run, which means that there will now be a greater focus on his foreign policy musings and background. Except that, as Michael Crowley noted in Politico, he doesn\u2019t really possess very much of either:\n\nAs Florida governor, Bush compiled a long domestic record on issues like education and immigration. Yet at a moment when America is winding down one war and ramping up another, he remains untested and opaque when it comes to war and peace.\n\n\u201cIts fair to say that Jeb\u2019s views on foreign policy are still in some level of formation. He\u2019s a former governor and he doesn\u2019t have foreign policy experience that people can easily point to,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for the George W. Bush White House.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. The more one looks at the possible 2016 GOP field, the more one realizes that, as deep as the field might be, pretty much none of them have any significant \u201cforeign policy experience.\u201d A lot of the GOP bench are governors, which means that they do have executive experience but did not bother with foreign policy matters (no matter what David Frum likes to claim). Indeed, as near as I can tell, no one in the 2016 field served at State/Defense/Treasury/intelligence, like George H.W. Bush. None of them have served in the military, like John McCain (CORRECTION: Rick Perry did serve in the US Air Force for five years in the 1970s. My apologies to Governor Perry for the oversight). None of them even have significant international business experience, like Mitt Romney.\n\nIn fact, surveying the 2016 potentials, only three candidates can claim anything approximating national security/foreign policy experience:\n\nIt\u2019s that last name that I find pretty amusing, because Rand Paul gives many GOP donors the vapors with respect to his foreign policy worldview. This hasn\u2019t stopped Paul from taking foreign affairs seriously as a policy issue. Furthermore, in contrast to, say, Bush or Santorum, Paul will avoid the foreign policy taint that comes from the Iraq war. Indeed, when the first 2016 debates come around, Paul will be in a position to argue that he has more experience and a better record on foreign policy than almost all of the other contenders.\n\n[This 10-second pause to allow every neoconservative reading this to rend their garments is brought to you by the good folks at the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Not sure which countries you should advocate bombing in 2016?! Let the McCain Institute advise your campaign about where to exercise the use of force in a positive way!!]\n\nNow, ordinarily, I wouldn\u2019t think that any of this matters too much for the primary campaign. Voters don\u2019t care all that much about foreign policy. Governors can compensate for a lack of foreign policy experience by collecting foreign policy advisers with lots of gravitas (indeed, as Crowley notes, Condoleezza Rice is advising Jeb Bush). And so forth.\n\nThat said, there are three ways in which 2016 might make foreign policy matter more. First, as the U.S. economy improves, it will become a harder issue to press on the campaign trail.It\u2019s obviously not going to go away, but focusing like a laser beam on it won\u2019t cut it this year.\n\nSecond, the wealth of 2016 GOP contenders will make it difficult for the foreign policy folk to congregate around one particular candidate. This is not going to be like the 2000 campaign, when George W. Bush essentially co-opted all of his father\u2019s foreign policy advisers. Bush was able to compensate for his own deficit of foreign policy experience by pointing to the surfeit of it from his confidantes. No single candidate will have that option this time around during the invisible primary stage.\n\nThird, if Hillary Clinton runs \u2014 and she\u2019s starting to make the necessary moves \u2014 then she\u2019s going to be able to blow the GOP field out of the water when it comes to foreign policy background. She\u2019ll obviously be vulnerable to attacks on her foreign policy record. But for those attacks to work, the GOP nominee is going to have to meet a minimum threshold of foreign policy/national security acumen. And at this point, the only two candidates that meet that threshold are Rubio and Paul.\n\nWhich means that \u201cthe more muscular peace-through-strength wing of the party,\u201d as Ari Fleischer puts it, is either going to have to go all in on Rubio or find another viable alternative to Paul in the next six months.\n\nDeveloping\u2026 in some very interesting ways."

As we've steadily overfished the seas, the stock of wild fish have been declining fast. Only around 25% of commercial stocks are in a reasonably healthy state, and some 30% of fish stocks are already considered collapsed. A famous study that appeared a few years ago in the journal Science predicted that if current trends continued, commercial fish stocks might utterly collapse by 2048\u2014meaning there would be virtually no wild seafood left.\n\nInstead, we may have farmed fish\u2014and indeed, chances are the salmon in your sushi roll was raised in a pen, not caught by fishermen. The global fish farming harvest is now at 110 million tons a year and is growing at an 8% clip. Farmed fish are an important source of protein and oils, but the practice can have serious environmental consequences, with farms pouring liquid waste into waterways. One of the biggest concerns, however, is disease, which can spread quickly among growing fish penned in a farm\u2014and then to their wild cousins in the ocean, placing additional burdens on a population that is already declining. Farmed salmon in particular have proved vulnerable to a condition called heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), a disease that can kill up to 20% of infected fish. Since it was first detected in a single farm in Norway in 1999, the disease has spread to hundreds of farms there and now in Britain as well\u2014but scientists didn't know what caused it.\n\nAn epidemiologist at Columbia University, however, may know. In a study published in the open-access journal PLoS ONE, a team led by W. Ian Lipkin\u2014the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health\u2014found that the disease may be caused by a previously unknown reovirus, a form of double-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals. And they found the virus using the tools of the geneticist.\n\nUsing more than 450 high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics, the team\u2014which included investigators from Norway\u2014looked for viral sequences in heart and kidney samples taken from fish that were suffering from HSMI and healthy farmed salmon. They found evidence of the virus in 96.5% of the HSMI samples and none of the healthy fish. \u201cOur data provide compelling evidence that HSMI is associated with infection with a new reovirus,\u201d said Gustavo Palacios, the first author of the study and an epidemiologist at the Center.\n\nFurther research is still needed to definitively prove that the reovirus is causing HSMI\u2014Koch's postulate, the gold standard for proving that a pathogen causes a disease, requires scientists to be able to culture the new germ from a sick subject and then infect a healthy one with it. The Columbia researchers haven't done that yet, but scientists in Norway are already developing a vaccine that would be able to protect farmed salmon\u2014and if it works, that would also be conclusive evidence that the reovirus is behind the disease. Given how important farmed fish is becoming as the oceans are emptied\u2014and given the risk that a disease in penned fish could decimate the waning stocks of wild salmon\u2014there's no time to wait."

A passenger in Pinex's car has claimed that the officers fired an initial shot without reason, provoking Pinex to flee.\n\nThe plaintiffs asked for a recording of what the officers claimed to have heard over the radio \u2014 and while a recording and related documents were available, they were not shared with the plaintiffs, according to the judge.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edmond Chang stated that one of the lawyers representing the officers, Jordan Marsh, knew about the recording before trial and \"intentionally withheld\" information from the court and plaintiffs, while another lawyer, Thomas Aumann, failed to make a reasonable inquiry to search for the recording and related documents.\n\n\"Because of the recording's untimely disclosure, the first trial was unfair and plaintiffs' trial presentation was hurt beyond repair by the surprise,\" the judge wrote.\n\nIn calling for a retrial, the judge ordered the city to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys fees.\n\nMarsh resigned following the federal judge's ruling.\n\nThe city law department, which announced Marsh's resignation, said it \"does not tolerate any action that would call into question the integrity of the lawyers who serve\" Chicago. It also said it was reviewing its training and evidence-gathering procedures.\n\nBut a lawyer for the Pinex family, Steve Greenberg, said Marsh's actions reflect on the city law department as a whole.

      "source": "By Dana Ford and Katherine Wojtecki, CNN\n\nupdated 9:30 PM EDT, Thu March 21, 2013\n\nChicago (CNN) -- Chicago school officials said Thursday that they plan to close dozens of schools in a bid to improve education and tackle a $1 billion deficit.\n\nThe move would shutter 61 school buildings, including 53 underused schools and one program. The cut represents roughly 10% of all elementary school facilities in Chicago Public Schools, the country's third-largest school district.\n\n\"Every child in every neighborhood in Chicago deserves access to a high-quality education that prepares them to succeed in life, but for too long children in certain parts of Chicago have been cheated out of the resources they need to succeed because they are in underutilized, under-resourced schools,\" said Barbara Byrd-Bennett, chief executive officer of CPS.\n\n\"As a former teacher and a principal, I've lived through school closings, and I know that this will not be easy, but I also know that in the end this will benefit our children. Like school systems across the country where enrollment has dropped, Chicago must make tough choices, and by consolidating these schools, we can focus on safely getting every child into a better performing school close to their home,\" she said.\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union opposes the closures, which it says would disproportionately affect African-American students. The union also warns the move would expose students to gang violence and turf wars, an apparent reference to neighborhood loyalties.\n\n\"This city cannot destroy that many schools at one time, and we contend that no school should be closed in the city of Chicago. These actions will not only put our students' safety and academic careers at risk but also further destabilize our neighborhoods,\" said Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis.\n\n\"We do not have a utilization crisis. What we have is a credibility crisis. CPS continues to peddle half-truths, lies and misinformation in order to justify its campaign to wipe out our schools and carry out this corporate-driven school-reform nonsense,\" she said.\n\nThe union went on strike last year.

It pitted the teachers union against Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who spoke in support of the school closings Thursday.\n\n\"This decision has been delayed for a decade, and it's our children and our city that have paid the price for inaction,\" he said. \"Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city's students get the resources they need to succeed in the classroom.\"\n\nCPS currently has 403,000 students, with seats for more than 511,000, and close to 140 of its 681 schools are more than half empty, according to the district.\n\nKatherine Wojtecki reported from Chicago.

      "source": "Mexican media went to work on Monday morning with a burning question: where were the remains of singer Juan Gabriel?\n\nReporters staked out an airport near Mexico City, where his remains were to arrive and be taken to the Bellas Artes cultural centre for a funeral, while officials in the singer\u2019s adopted hometown of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and his birth state of Michoac\u00e1n made their cases for where \u201cJuanga\u201d \u2013 as Juan Gabriel was affectionately known \u2013 should be returned to. The location of his burial will certainly become Mexico\u2019s Graceland.\n\nDespite fevered speculation, his legal representative called for calm, saying the singer\u2019s children \u201cwant to be alone with the body of their father\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes forget that in addition to being an idol that belonged to Mexico, Juan Gabriel had a family,\u201d his attorney Silvia Urquidi told Televisa. \u201cChildren who have not processed the pain they feel.\u201d\n\nMexico is still reeling from the loss of an icon, whose music struck a common chord, serving as the soundtrack to countless lives. His showmanship, effeminate appearance and fondness for sequins and shiny shirts overcame the gender stereotypes of a chauvinist society, while his lyrics about love and loss spoke to all.\n\nThat Juanga overcame hardships in early life \u2013 he was orphaned at a young age along with his nine siblings, and later served 18 months in prison on robbery charges \u2013 to hit the big time, only added to the appeal of a performer with whom the often oppressed masses could easily identify.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely this transcendence from high-brow to low-brow with Juan Gabriel. He straddled all the social classes,\u201d says Esteban Illades, editor of Nexos, a high-brow Mexican magazine. \u201cHe didn\u2019t write about social problems, he didn\u2019t write about the economy. He wrote about what every Mexican could feel, even if you were rich or you were poor.\u201d\n\nMexicans have mourned Juanga in the streets and online since his death, aged 66, on Sunday.\n\nMany told of his importance in their lives, while others spoke of his significance to the nation and to his hometown of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a city plagued by intense drug-related violence.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the biggest achievement of his career is vindicating an aesthetic that belonged \u2013 at the start [of his career] \u2013 on the margins,\u201d V\u00edctor Santana wrote in the online publication Horizontal. \u201cFor entire generations of Mexicans, Juan Gabriel\u2019s music meant an authentic sentimental education.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I met Juan Gabriel, he told me that he often read Seneca. He was a stoic romantic,\u201d tweeted musician Julieta Venegas.\n\n\u201cFrom the first time I saw him in the early 80s, in the nightclub El Patio, he seduced me, like he did that night to everyone listening with a true fervour,\u201d wrote columnist Guadalupe Loaeza in Reforma. \u201cWhat most fascinated me was the response of the men. I saw how they looked at him. They did it with curiosity, but above all with a certain fascination.\u201d\n\nGabriel was believed to be gay, but he never publicly confirmed this, despite attracting hoardes of male fans in a country with a heavy culture of machismo. He once told a television presenter pushing the issue: \u201cThey say you don\u2019t ask about what\u2019s obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuan Gabriel was a true punk,\u201d tweeted writer Yuri Herrera. \u201cIn a country of machos, he danced as he damn well pleased.\u201d\n\nDespite widespread adoration, Juanga was known to court controversy, occasionally entering the political fray. In 2000, he propped up the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary party, penning a song for its 2000 election campaign as the country was preparing to cast aside its one-party rule.\n\nHis views are expected to become better known in his death. His lawyer told the media that Juanga wrote a letter for her to deliver to the president, telling \u201cfor the first time how he sees the country\u201d."

Gubicza said, for his era as a player (1984-1997), that Rickey Henderson best reminded him of Trout.\n\nBut, Gubicza added \"there is no doubt Trout is our modern day Mickey Mantle\" and that \"Mantle was the man and so is Trout.\"\n\nWith that, here's a statistical breakdown of Trout and Mantle through their first three full MLB seasons.\n\nMickey Mantle (1952-54): 71 HR, 281 RBI, 470 hits, 328 runs, 308 strikeouts and a batting average of .303.\n\nMike Trout (2012-2014): 93 HR, 291 RBI, 545 hits, 353 runs, 459 strikeouts and .311 average.\n\nBoth were elected to the All-Star Game in those first three seasons.

By the end of his third MLB season, Mantle had already been part of a trio of World Series-winning Yankees teams. Trout has only made the postseason once (2014) and the Angels were swept by the Royals.\n\nThe stats are similar, the comparisons are there ... and hard to ignore.\n\nIt's hard to not see Trout making the Hall of Fame as a first-ballot selection, as Mantle was in 1974, when Trout's playing days are over.\n\nAnd, whenever the end comes for Trout (hopefully, not for many years), those of us who witnessed his amazing acts at the plate and on the field in an Angels uniform will count ourselves lucky."

      "source": "For the hotel industry, the past year has been bad enough to make shareholders want to empty the minibar.\n\nIn 2015, while the S&P 500 was essentially flat, the widely followed Baird/STR index of 41 hotel stocks fell a grizzly-bearish 20.1%. The hospitality-suite rout continued in the early weeks of this year, with the stocks of several hotel chains dropping by 10% or more.\n\nBut here\u2019s the confounding thing: The stocks plummeted even as the industry posted all-time highs for occupancy rates and revenue per available room, or RevPAR. \u201cWe\u2019ve been breaking records,\u201d says Jan Freitag, senior vice president at travel-research company STR. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to continue to break records.\u201d Indeed, Freitag and many money managers believe the disconnect between market sentiment and the industry\u2019s fundamentals has become a chasm\u2014creating an opportunity for bargain hunters.\n\nThe bears\u2019 pessimism isn\u2019t unfounded. Hotel revenue growth has begun to decelerate after a long positive cycle. STR projects that RevPAR, which now stands at about $80, will grow 5.7% in 2016, down from 6.5% in 2015 and a sizzling 8.1% in 2014. As in other industries whose shares have looked shaky of late, you can pin some of the blame on China\u2019s slowdown, since Chinese leisure and business travelers have become major revenue drivers. \u201cMarkets like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Miami could see softness because of slower growth from the Chinese consumer,\u201d says Chad Beynon, senior lodging analyst at Macquarie Capital.\n\nThe industry also faces a lingering, low-level panic about Airbnb and what the home-rental business will mean for the sector\u2014particularly in the battle for millennial loyalties. Investors \u201cthink Airbnb will do to hotels what Uber did to taxis,\u201d says David Loeb, managing director for investment managers Robert W. Baird. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not a fair analogy.\u201d If anything, he argues, the data suggest that hotels and Airbnb can peacefully coexist. Even as Airbnb surged in 2015\u2014the company estimates that its network housed 40 million guests, double the number from 2014, in 34,000 cities\u2014hotels scored a record-breaking year of their own. In November, the most recent month for which numbers are available, occupancy rates hit an unprecedented 66.7%, while average room rates topped $120 for the first time.\n\nBeynon sees occupancy levels staying high through 2016 and beyond, \u201cthanks to corporate profits, convention calendars, and leisure travel fueled by baby boomers\u201d\u2014business segments where Airbnb\u2019s impact hasn\u2019t been as great. Bullish investors also say hotels are finally benefiting from their decades-long effort to create hipper, boutique subsidiaries. Examples include the W and Aloft units of Starwood Hotels & Resorts hot , Hyatt\u2019s Andaz chain h , and Hilton Worldwide Holdings\u2019 Canopy and Curio. These boutiques\u2019 trendier on-site bars and restaurants and locally inspired design appeal to travelers put off by the cookie-cutter feel of larger chains\u2014especially millennials, whose financial clout will mushroom in years to come.\n\nOverall, the hotel industry\u2019s anticipated revenue growth for this year is expected to outpace the 4% to 5% that analysts foresee for the entire S&P 500. The broader slowdown in hospitality will continue to hurt some stocks. But value investors say others are well suited for a rebound from today\u2019s lows. One favorite: Extended Stay America stay , which offers longer-term lodging options at its nearly 700 hotels. With its low room rates and fully equipped kitchens, the chain has plenty of ammunition for any war with Airbnb, and isn\u2019t heavily reliant on Chinese travelers. \u201cThey don\u2019t do franchising, so every hotel is theirs,\u201d boosting the parent company\u2019s revenue, says Loeb. He credits Extended Stay\u2019s management with an impressive turnaround, but the stock still trades at a modest 13 times expected 2016 earnings. Macquarie\u2019s 2016 estimates of the chain\u2019s RevPAR growth: a whopping 10.9%.\n\nBeynon favors Hilton hlt , a $12 billion giant that Macquarie recently upgraded to \u201coutperform\u201d with a $30 price target, up from its current $18. Hilton has the industry\u2019s largest pipeline of new rooms hitting the market, according to Beynon, who also likes the company\u2019s recently initiated dividend and share-buyback program. Hilton\u2019s projected revenue growth for 2016 is a healthy 6.2%. One potential catalyst to goose the stock: This week\u2019s launch of Tru by Hilton, a new, mid-budget brand designed to court younger travelers.\n\nThe elephant in an investor\u2019s hotel room: the Starwood-Marriott merger, which has been signed but isn\u2019t yet closed. The $12.2 billion deal would create the largest hotel company in the world, with 1.1 million rooms in 5,500 properties, and would certainly increase competitive pressure on other chains.\n\nBut Beynon points out that the aftershocks of that earthquake may actually benefit shareholders of Hilton. Assuming that current S&P 500 component Starwood gets swallowed up, many analysts think Hilton will take its place in the index. That tends to be positive for any stock, since it leads more institutional investors to automatically buy its shares. Beynon says Hilton is \u201cthe most attractive name in lodging right now.\u201d Given how oversold the industry is, now could be a good time for investors to book a room.\n\nA version of this article appears in the February 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cHotel Stocks With Staying Power.\u201d"

Guillen told him they were made possible because he hustled to first base to start a rally.\n\nExplained Guillen, \"If I have to stroke a player, I will. If I have to get all over a player, I will. I'm not afraid to get on Hanley if I have to, but he also has to understand that he doesn't have to hit the ball out of the ballpark to help us. Maybe those are the kind of things he hasn't heard enough of.\n\n\"He's been great. He hit one ball where he stood there and watched it. I thought, you better not be standing on first base when you should be on second, easy. It went out. I mean, way out. So that's okay.\"\n\nOf all the players looking for a bounceback year -- Buster Posey of the Giants, Adam Wainwright of the Cardinals, Jason Heyward of the Braves, etc. -- no player can transform the National League pennant race like Ramirez. A former batting champion with a .520 slugging percentage entering last year, Ramirez played in only 92 games, batted .243, slugged .379 and underwent surgery on his left shoulder. When the Marlins signed free agent Jose Reyes, Ramirez was forced to switch from shortstop to third base. He reported to camp in better shape than he was at this time last year and, according to hitting coach Eduardo Perez, has looked dominant once again.\n\n\"It wasn't just the shoulder, it was his back, too,\" Perez said. \"He couldn't generate any power. Now we've got him back to where he was before. The big thing is getting him started earlier. He has a lot of moving parts in his swing, and when you do that you need to get started a little earlier. They key is making sure he gets his [stride] foot down early enough. And he's looked great. I mean, great. I'm talking about a guy who could put up an MVP-type season. That's how good he looks.\"\n\nGuillen said Ramirez has embraced third base despite initial reports that he resisted the move. \"You never heard anything from him like that,\" Guillen said. \"People may have written stuff, but he never said it. I told him, 'You have two choices: you can play third base and like it, or you can play third base and be miserable.'\"\n\nThe Marlins are having a best-case scenario spring. Ace Josh Johnson is healthy, Ramirez looks like his old self and their first look at their new ballpark this week was nothing sort of inspirational. The place could be an important ingredient in how they play.\n\nThink about it: The Marlins are moving from one of the two or three worst venues in baseball to what could become one of the two or three best. The early reports are that the Marlins successfully created a clean break from the red-brick, green-seated retro ballpark trend that had run its course. They managed to build a retractable roof ballpark that seems cozy from the seating bowl. The players said the park played small when the roof was open, but big, especially gap-to-gap, when the roof was closed. It should create plenty of triples for Reyes and Emilio Bonifacio.\n\nSome minor tweaks will no doubt be needed. Some players, for instance, think the lime green outfield wall may need to be darker to create a better hitting background. But the players raved about the creature comforts and the energy in the ballpark -- no small factor when you're used to playing in a half-empty football stadium.\n\nLook at it this way: The Marlins had absolutely no homefield advantage in their previous home. Over the past three seasons, all while finishing last in attendance, the Marlins had a better record on the road (124-122) than at home (115-125).\n\nThe average major league team plays about 52 percentage points better at home than on the road. With just an average homefield advantage, based on how they played last year, the Marlins should be 11 wins better this year, which puts them at 83 wins. But if the ballpark is filled with newfound excitement -- and why not, with a strong season-ticket base and the quirkiness of an aquarium behind home plate and a funky Peter Max-like home run machine in the outfield -- the homefield effect should be better than average. And if you add a healthy Johnson (he made only nine starts last year) and free agent additions Mark Buehrle and Heath Bell to the pitching staff, and with three MVP candidates in the lineup -- a healthy Ramirez, Reyes and Giancarlo Stanton -- you begin to understand why the Marlins are a legit playoff contender.\n\nKeep an eye on Cardinals second baseman Tyler Greene, who at age 28 finally may become another breakout player from the 2005 Draft, the greatest draft ever (Justin Upton, Alex Gordon, Ryan Zimmerman, Ryan Braun, Ricky Romero, Troy Tulowitzki, Cameron Maybin, Andrew McCutchen, Jay Bruce, Jacoby Ellsbury, Clay Buchholz, etc.). Greene has played 616 minor league games and never hit much in sporadic play in the majors (.218 in 150 games). But he's a terrific athlete with impressive tools -- plus power, speed and throwing arm -- who Cardinals sources say looks like a different player this spring. For one, having moved from shortstop, he has a chance to lock down the second base job. He is the preferred candidate in competition with Skip Schumaker and Daniel Descalso.\n\n\"The other day he turned a double play I guarantee only about five other guys in the game could turn,\" GM John Mozeliak said. \"He did it because of arm strength.\"\n\nSaid one Cardinal, \"He has so much ability it's scary. He has the potential to hit 20 homers and steal 40 bases. You put that at second base? Wow.\"\n\nMoreover, Cardinals sources say Greene is more relaxed under manager Mike Matheny than he was under Tony La Russa. Said another team source, \"If he missed a groundball, right away he would look around and think what Tony was thinking about him. You can see he's a lot more comfortable this spring.\"\n\nQuestions remain about Greene. He strikes out too much and needs to show more consistency. But he has posted an .851 OPS across four seasons in Triple A. With nothing left to prove there and no minor league options left, he finally may be ready for the next level.\n\nHow balanced is the National League field? When the analytics department of one NL club ran its projected numbers, it found only one team that will win 90 games: Philadelphia.\n\nIn 16 full seasons under the three-division format, only once, in 2006, did only one NL team win at least 90 games. (The Mets, with 97.) Back then the imbalance between leagues was so great that NL teams played .390 baseball against AL teams that year (104-163), depressing the overall win total. The league has averaged 3.6 90-win teams per year since 1996."

The only trouble is that I can't remember his name, so I am shamelessly using this column to jog his memory.\n\nCome on, cobber. Cough up. You remember the bet. It must have been about 20 years ago that we were all sitting in a bar in Melbourne, drinking prodigious quantities of Victoria Bitter. I was then a visiting professor of European Thought at Monash University. (I know, I know: I want to thank the academic who invited me for his excellent sense of humour, and I continue to regret that he was mysteriously deprived of his post shortly after my last lecture, a frenzied dithyramb of unreconstructed Euro-scepticism).\n\nOn that particular evening, I was teasing some of my colleagues about their ever-so-slightly correct way of thinking. There was a scholar of gender studies and a theorist of animal rights, and there was some tut-tutting when I suggested that Aboriginal art could not really be compared in quality with, say, the masterpieces of the Florentine Renaissance. But what really got them going was when we moved on to the constitution. Tell you what, I said: I bet you the Queen is still the Australian head of state in \u2013 and I paused, trying to think of a date so far in the future as to make the bet seem fair \u2013 the year 2000! A throaty cackle went up from the group. \"No way, mate,\" they said, republicans to a person.\n\nI shook hands on the wager with one of them \u2013 an expert on Saussure, I think \u2013 and we even wrote it down. The wretched thing is that I lost the bit of paper, and by the time 2000 rolled round, with the Queen still firmly on her throne as the constitutional monarch of Australia, I had forgotten all about it. In fact, I might never have remembered at all, had I not been sitting yesterday in a crowded Putney Odeon, watching the afternoon showing of The King's Speech. At one stage Logue, the voice coach, reminds the future king that he is about to reign over Australia, and I thought, strewth \u2013 it's still true. We are now some way into 2011, and Her Maj occupies the same position in Oz (and Canada and New Zealand) as her father. That's incredible, I thought \u2013 and where's my $100?\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons why the film is so gripping, and why it deserves to win every Oscar going. Director Tom Hooper has done a quite brilliant job. Colin Firth is wonderfully plausible in conveying the tortured duty of George VI. Geoffrey Rush gives a Shakespearean quality to the voice coach \u2013 a Fool-in-Lear who is both impertinent and achingly loyal. As the king's coquettish wife, Helena Bonham-Carter reminds us of the key political role once played by the woman most of us remember as the beaming old Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. The whole thing is a triumph, and you will find tears pricking your eyes if not pouring down your cheeks when we get to the climax, and the King manages more or less without a hitch or a stammer to read his first wartime broadcast to the nation. We see him walking out of the Palace studio to the acclaim of his staff; we see them clapping at the BBC; we see huge crowds cheering in the Mall, and for a second you are invited to ask yourself, why? Why do we feel so proud and so moved? For heaven's sake, the fellow has only succeeded in semi-competently reading a few pages of typescript into a microphone. He didn't even write it. Why is it so important to us that he should overcome his b-b-b-blinking stammer and discharge this routine task? The answer, of course, is that he is the King, and at the outbreak of a terrifying war he incarnates the nation, its hopes and fears, in a way that no one else can.\n\nMy old chum Jonny Freedland of The Guardian wrote a lovely piece the other day, in which he brooded on the success of The King's Speech, and the fascination with royalty that still exists \u2013 as he was forced to concede \u2013 in the hearts of the people. Many years ago, Freedland wrote a first-rate polemic called Bring Home The Revolution, in which he called for Britain to adopt the republicanism of her American progeny. It hasn't happened. It won't happen. There isn't a cat's chance in hell of it happening. In a way that is both irrational and astonishing, human beings still seem to respond to, and respect, the concept of hereditary transfer of authority. I don't just mean in African tribal systems. Look at the supposedly socialist and egalitarian systems of Korea (father to son) or Cuba (brother to brother).\n\nLook at Syria (father to son). Look at Egypt, where the crowds have just woken \u2013 under the influence of Tunisia \u2013 to interrupt what would have otherwise been the narcotic transition from Mubarak the elder to Mubarak the younger. Look at America \u2013 revolutionary, republican America \u2013 where for the last 20 years politics has been dominated by two families, the Bushes and the Clintons, and where there is now talk of Jeb Bush succeeding his father and brother.\n\nIn many of these cases, the family transitions are, of course, outrageous to democracy, but they reflect a weird superstition, a prehistoric yearning that still exists in our species. That is why the dualism of the British system is so cunning and so effective. The kings and queens of Britain are no longer called upon to do, but to be.\n\nPrince William will not take any executive decisions about emptying dustbins, let alone war and peace, and that is frankly a thoroughly good thing. But people all over the country will recognise that his wedding is an event in the life of the nation; and in spite of all their cynicism, Jonny Freedland's legions of Guardian readers will be unable to stop themselves buying royal wedding mugs and dishcloths and watching the whole thing on TV with an inexplicable sense of pleasure. As for whether William will be King of Australia \u2013 I certainly wouldn't bet against it."

The officers all survived the crash. (Phoenix Police Department)\n\nThe driver, Marc LaQuon Payne, 44, was booked into jail on three charges of first-degree attempted murder. Police said impairment may have been a factor in the crash.\n\nHours later, the Phoenix police chief denounced the incident as \u201can unprovoked, violent, intentional act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese officers could have easily been killed and I thank God that we\u2019re not planning three funerals right now,\u201d Police Chief Joe Yahner said at a news conference Tuesday. Before he showed local media outlets surveillance footage of the crash, he paused. \u201cI gotta warn you \u2026 it\u2019s graphic as heck,\u201d he told them.\n\n[Nation\u2019s officers on edge as deaths in Dallas bring yearly toll among police to 25]\n\nFour surveillance cameras captured the incident from different angles as it unfolded. About 1:45 a.m. Tuesday, Payne drove an Altima into the QuikTrip, a busy gas station just off the Interstate 17 highway in central Phoenix.\n\nFootage showed Payne stopping at a gas pump, then putting his car in reverse and parking it on the west side of the parking lot.\n\nFor several minutes, police said, Payne sat in his car with the headlights off. Then, suddenly, he flashed his headlights on and began accelerating toward the store, directly toward the officers.\n\nHis car struck the group and came to a stop after it shattered the glass entrance to the convenience store.\n\nThe department has not named the three officers involved, but identified the one who was run over first as a 41-year-old sergeant with 18 years on the force. He suffered a broken leg and is resting at home, police said.\n\nAnother officer, a 36-year-old man, has eight years of experience and managed to escape the oncoming vehicle, police said. This officer sustained minor injuries after he ran over and fought to detain the driver, police said.\n\nPolice said the officer who was sent flying air is a 33-year-old man who sustained a head injury; it was his first day on his assigned squad.\n\n\u201c[The new officer] flies about eight feet in the air, smashes into the front glass of the QT and goes down,\u201d Yahner said. \u201c\u2026 Unbelievable, our officer that hits the front of the glass and smashes the glass, gets back up, engages in a fight to take the suspect in custody. [The suspect] runs over us and then he still fights with us as we\u2019re trying to take him into custody.\u201d\n\nPolice later told The Washington Post that a Taser was used to subdue Payne and take him into custody.\n\n[Number of law enforcement officers fatally shot this year up significantly after ambush attacks, report says]\n\nThe video showed several civilians at the gas station rushing over after the crash. No other bystanders or gas station employees were reported injured.\n\nA woman who answered the phone at the QuikTrip location Wednesday morning referred all questions to the chain\u2019s corporate office, which did not immediately respond to inquiries.\n\nYahner\u2019s comments pointed to an increasing tension between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 67 law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year as of July 20, an increase over the 62 officers killed in the same period last year. The nonprofit group\u2019s mid-year report noted a troubling increase in some of those deaths occurring in \u201cambush\u201d attacks.\n\n\u201cOur Phoenix police officers were targeted. We have all heard about officers being targeted and ambushed in communities across the nation,\u201d Yahner said. \u201cBut this happened here. This happened in Phoenix. This happened to your Phoenix police officers. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\nPayne, shirtless and silent, avoided answering reporters\u2019 questions as he was booked into jail Tuesday, several local news stations reported. Arizona court records show that Payne pleaded guilty to three charges of aggravated assault in 1998 but has maintained a clear record since then. According to ABC 15 News, detailed court documents showed Payne attacked three Phoenix police officers during a traffic stop that year.\n\nPayne is being held without bond until his next court appearance, scheduled for Sept. 20, records show.\n\nAs news of the crash spread, some articles online tried to connect Payne to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe head of the Phoenix chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement told ABC15 News that Payne was not in any way connected with their cause.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we vehemently deny knowledge of this person,\u201d the Rev. Reginald Walton told the news station.\n\nAmerica is safer than it was decades ago. But homicides are up again in Chicago and cities across the country\n\nAfter Baton Rouge, a weary fear builds among those who protect and serve\n\nMother of three survives car crash \u2014 only to be gunned down by the other driver, police say"

      "source": "Ed Miliband (left) and Nigel Farage\n\nAs I predicted on Friday, Labour is this morning in the grip of a Ukip Crisis. \u201cMiliband under pressure as Labour splits over how to win back voters,\u201d reports the Guardian. \u201cElitist Ed is heading for disaster: Labour MPs says party leaders have their head in the sand over 'terrible' European elections result,\u201d reports the Mail.\n\nAs if things weren\u2019t bad enough, Tony Blair has also chipped in. \u201cIt is right to be worried when a party like Ukip comes first in the European election, it would be foolish not to be. But on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of Britain in the 21st century,\u201d said our former PM, in an intervention that will enrage both the Left and Right in equal measure.\n\nBlair is whistling in the wind. We are currently witnessing a flight from reason. The false narrative that \u201cUkip are as much of a threat to Labour as they are to the Tories\u201d has taken hold and, for the while at least, there is no shaking it.\n\nBecause they will become useful at a later date, I\u2019ll just lay out the facts. The Lord Ashcroft exit poll of the Euro elections found Ukip taking votes from the Tories by a margin of 2:1. That is when their vote share falls in a range between 30 per cent down to about 15 per cent. Other polling has shown that once their vote sinks below that level, they start to take votes from the Tories by margins of 3:1, 4:1, 5:1 even 6:1. The Tories privately put the cross-over point at between 10-11 per cent. That\u2019s the point where Ukip start to take votes from the other parties a little more evenly (though the bulk of votes still come from Conservative switchers). Ukip are today polling 13 per cent. They will be well below that come election day.\n\nPart of the reason for this madness is blind panic. Labour will lose the next election and the party has finally woken up to that fact. So later today Ed Miliband will go to Thurrock, one of Labour\u2019s target seats, and he will begin to dog-whistle to Ukip voters on immigration.\n\nHis speech will be dressed up. It will include lots of references to disfranchised working-class communities. There will be lots of condemnation of the exploitation of migrant workers. But it will be a good old-fashioned dog-whistle speech just the same.\n\nMiliband doesn\u2019t want to be whistling Nigel Farage\u2019s tune, of course. He hoped to spend this week issuing vacuous homilies about One Nation Britain. But he is panicking. And he\u2019s trying to stay one step ahead of his own MPs who have finally turned round and said \u201cenough is enough\u201d.\n\nI have a lot of sympathy with those MPs. When the likes of Simon Danczuck and Frank Field call for a more conservative stance from Labour on issues like welfare, and public spending and \u2013 yes \u2013 immigration, they are echoing calls I\u2019ve been making for the last four years. But the hard truth is it\u2019s too late for that now.\n\nMiliband has spent every day since he was elected Labour leader deploying the same message. It is the wrong message. It is a message that will lead his party to a crushing defeat in 12 months' time. But it has at least been a consistent message. \u201cLabour can win from the Left,\" he told his party. \u201cWe can win by being true to ourselves. We will defend welfare. We will make the case for additional public spending. We will not get into an arms race on immigration.\u201d\n\nIf Miliband tries to change that message now, three things will happen. The first is the Labour Party will implode.\n\nFault lines which have been papered over for years will split open. The country may not have been listening to Miliband, but his party has. And they\u2019ve trusted him. They\u2019ve trusted him when he told them they could win from the Left. They\u2019ve trusted him when they told him they could win by being true to themselves. He cannot turn round now, less than a year from polling day, and say \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m sorry, I lied. The only way I can win is by pretending I\u2019m Nigel Farage.\u201d\n\nThe Left will break away. The students will break away. The Iraq war refuseniks will break away. The Lib Dem refugees will break away. And for what? So Ed Miliband can shore up that minuscule percentage of the Labour base that is flitting with Ukip? Is that seriously what he\u2019s planning? Abandoning the 35 per cent strategy for the 1 per cent strategy?\n\nThe second reason is this: it simply won\u2019t work. What is the one thing we\u2019ve learnt from these elections? It is that that the most valuable political currency is authenticity.\n\nDoes Miliband honestly think he will be able \u2013 at this late hour \u2013 to convince people he is the new Huey Long? That if he mouths small-c Blue Labour conservatism people will listen, and consider and, most importantly, believe?\n\nPeople know who Miliband is. They know he is a nice, middle-class, north London liberal intellectual. When he revealed on ITV\u2019s Good Morning show he didn\u2019t know the price of a weekly shop his aides tore their hair out in frustration. Why? Did they actually think the viewers were sitting there saying \u201cBlimey. That Ed Miliband doesn\u2019t know how much his shopping costs. And there we were thinking he was just like us.\u201d\n\nThere is a final reason Labour\u2019s leader must stick with his chosen strategy to the bitter end. This small \"c\"/Blue Labour/call it what you will agenda is important for Labour. There will come a time, if it wants to regain power, when it will need to look again at its stances on immigration and welfare and law and order and public spending and Europe and its broader fiscal credibility.\n\nBut that time is not now. Not whilst Nigel \u2013 \u201cyou know the difference\u201d \u2013 Farage is continuing his victory tour of the bar-rooms of Britain. Yes, we need a serious discussion about immigration. But that discussion cannot be held against a backdrop of \u201cNo dogs, no blacks, no Romanians\u201d. The far Right is on the march across Europe. Today is not the day for the leader of the Labour Party to be picking up and dusting off the race card.\n\nThere was a moment \u2013 perhaps back in 2012, when the Tories were in the midst of their own omnishambles, and Labour was riding high in the polls \u2013 when Miliband might just have pulled it off. The voters may have been prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. He may have had just enough political capital to convince his party to shift to the Right. But that window of opportunity has closed now.\n\nMiliband has been a poor leader of his party. But he is basically a decent man, and he is entering the final 12 months of his political career. Are people really going to ask him to spend that time stumping the nation banging on about how if elected he will crack down on migrants, or take away people\u2019s benefits? Is that really going to be the final chapter of his political legacy?\n\nHe has came this far. We know how the journey ends, but it is his journey, and he needs to be left to finish it in his own way, on his own terms. Miliband shouldn\u2019t go to Thurrock. He shouldn\u2019t chase after Farage. Instead, he should go back to north London, and spend a couple of days mapping out how to fight the election campaign he has always wanted to fight.\n\nHe owes it to his party. More importantly, he owes it to himself.\n\n\u2022 Get the latest comment and analysis from the Telegraph\n\n\u2022 Read more from our news and politics bloggers"

      "source": "Finally, in 1959, Arthur Wang of Hill & Wang agreed to take on \u201cNight.\u201d The first reviews were positive. Gertrude Samuels, writing in the Book Review, called it a \u201cslim volume of terrifying power.\u201d Alfred Kazin, writing in The Reporter, said Wiesel\u2019s account of his loss of faith had a \u201cparticular poignancy.\u201d After the Kazin review, the book \u201cgot great reviews all over America, but it didn\u2019t influence the sales,\u201d Wiesel said.\n\nThe trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 brought the Holocaust into the mainstream of American consciousness. Other survivors began writing their stories \u2014 but with higher visibility came the first glimmerings of criticism. In a roundup of Holocaust literature in Commentary in 1964, the critic A. Alvarez said \u201cNight\u201d was \u201cbeyond criticism\u201d as a \u201chuman document,\u201d but called it \u201ca failure as a work of art.\u201d Wiesel, he argued, had failed to \u201ccreate a coherent artistic world out of one which was the deliberate negation of all values.\u201d\n\nBy the early \u201970s, the Holocaust had become a topic of study in universities, spurred in part by the rise of \u201cethnic studies\u201d more generally and a surge of interest in Jewish history after Israel\u2019s dramatic military victory in the Israeli-Arab wars of 1967 and 1973. Wiesel, who had moved to New York in the mid-\u201950s, began lecturing regularly at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan and teaching at the City University of New York. (Since 1976 he has taught at Boston University.)\n\nAlthough his books were all reviewed respectfully, some critics questioned Wiesel\u2019s role as a self-appointed witness. \u201cHis personal project has been to keep the wounds of Auschwitz open by repeatedly pouring the salt of new literary reconstructions upon them, and thus to prevent the collective Jewish memory \u2014 and his own \u2014 from quietly letting the wounds heal,\u201d Leon Wieseltier, now the literary editor of The New Republic, wrote in Commentary in 1974. Reviewing Wiesel\u2019s novel \u201cThe Oath,\u201d about a pogrom, Wieseltier criticized Wiesel for \u201cturning history into legend.\u201d His characters were \u201carchetypes of the varieties of Jewish pain,\u201d Wieseltier wrote, so \u201cwhat remains is ... a kind of elaborate superficiality which does justice neither to the author\u2019s intentions nor to his terrible subject matter.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, President Carter appointed Wiesel to a commission that eventually created the Holocaust Museum. In Wiesel\u2019s mind, the \u201creal breakthrough\u201d that brought \u201cNight\u201d into wide view came in 1985, when he spoke out against President Reagan\u2019s planned visit to the Bitburg military cemetery in Germany, where SS members were buried. While Reagan was awarding him a Congressional Gold Medal at the White House, Wiesel told him: \u201cThat place, Mr. President, is not your place. Your place is with the victims of the SS.\u201d The next day, Wiesel\u2019s words were on front pages worldwide. (Reagan still made the trip.)\n\nWiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the following year. The Nobel committee called Wiesel \u201ca messenger to mankind,\u201d teaching \u201cpeace, atonement and human dignity.\u201d Wiesel\u2019s \u201ccommitment, which originated in the sufferings of the Jewish people, has been widened to embrace all repressed peoples and races.\u201d By the late \u201990s, \u201cNight\u201d was a standard high school and college text, selling around 400,000 copies a year.\n\nYet some critics have homed in on the very qualities that have helped \u201cNight\u201d find a broad readership. Some have criticized Wiesel for universalizing \u2014 and even Christianizing \u2014 Jewish suffering. In \u201cThe Holocaust in American Life\u201d (1999), the historian Peter Novick cites crucifixion imagery in \u201cNight\u201d as evidence of the \u201cun-Jewish\u201d or Christian tenor to much Holocaust commemoration. Others have suggested Wiesel may have revised the book to appeal to non-Jewish readers. In a 1996 essay, Naomi Seidman, a Jewish studies professor at Berkeley\u2019s Graduate Theological Union, detected strong notes of vengeance in the Yiddish version. In the final scene, after the camp has been liberated, Wiesel writes of young men going into Weimar \u201cto rape German girls.\u201d But there\u2019s no mention of rape in the subsequent French or English translations. Wiesel said his thinking had changed between versions. \u201cIt would have been a disgrace to reduce such an event to simple vengeance.\u201d\n\nTo Lawrence L. Langer, an eminent scholar of Holocaust literature and a friend of Wiesel\u2019s, what sets \u201cNight\u201d apart is a moral honesty that \u201chelps undermine the sentimental responses to the Holocaust.\u201d To Langer, \u201cNight\u201d remains an essential companion \u2014 or antidote \u2014 to \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank.\u201d That book, with its ringing declaration that \u201cI still believe that people are really good at heart,\u201d is \u201ceasy for teachers to teach,\u201d Langer said, but \u201cfrom the text you don\u2019t know what happened when she died of typhus, half-starved at Bergen-Belsen.\u201d Wiesel takes a similar view. \u201cWhere Anne Frank\u2019s book ends,\u201d he said, \u201cmine begins.\u201d\n\nRachel Donadio is a writer and editor at the Book\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page BR27 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: The Story of \u2018Night\u2019.

One out later, Andy Pettitte walked out to pitch the bottom of the ninth inning, or so it seemed.\n\nJoe Girardi let Pettitte warm up, then came out and removed him for closer Mariano Rivera before Pettitte faced a batter. The Yankees' manager had created some more time for Mariano Rivera to warm up.\n\n\"He (Pettitte) wasn't going to throw a pitch,'' Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said, according to the Minneapolis StarTribune. \"Kind of tired, to tell you the truth. Don't normally get that long between innings. You know what's going on there.\"\n\nMLB.com noted that, as home-plate umpire Brian O'Nora tried to get Pettitte to speed things up, Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli stopped to rub something out of his eye, which ate up more time before Rivera was summoned.\n\nRivera pitched the ninth inning and saved both of Wednesday's Yankees wins in Minneapolis.\n\n\"We didn't want to have Mo up unless we knew we were going to use him,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.\n\nAccording to radio station ESPN 1500-AM in the Twin Cities, Gardenhire said he didn't think giving Rivera more time to warm up cost the Twins the night game. However, he added this parting shot: \"That's a situation Major League Baseball needs to take care of when stuff like that happens. If you don't have a guy ready in the bullpen, if your starter goes out there he should have to face a hitter.''\n\nWhat do you think? Barring an injury, should Major League Baseball require a pitcher to face at least one batter if he goes out to warm up before an inning?\n\nTo report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor\n\n.

      "source": "LAGO ENRIQUILLO, Dominican Republic \u2014 Steadily, mysteriously, like in an especially slow science fiction movie, the largest lake in the Caribbean has been rising and rising, devouring tens of thousands of acres of farmland, ranches and whatever else stands in its way.\n\nLago Enriquillo swallowed Juan Malmolejos\u2019s banana grove. It swamped Teodoro Pe\u00f1a\u2019s yuccas and mango trees. In the low-lying city of Boca de Cachon, the lake so threatens to subsume the entire town that the government has sent the army to rebuild it from scratch on a dusty plain several miles away.\n\nJose Joaquin Diaz believes that the lake took the life of his brother, Victor. Victor committed suicide, he said, shortly after returning from a life abroad to see the family cattle farm, the one begun by his grandfather, underwater.\n\n\u201cHe could not believe it was all gone, and the sadness was too much,\u201d Mr. Diaz said, as a couple of men rowed a fishing boat over what had been a pasture.\n\nTheories abound, but a conclusive answer remains elusive as to why the lake \u2014 as well as its nearby sibling in Haiti, Lac Azuei, which now spills over the border between the two on the island of Hispaniola \u2014 has risen so much. Researchers say the surge may have few if any precedents worldwide.\n\n\u201cThere are no records, to the best of our knowledge, of such sudden growth of lakes of similar size,\u201d said Jorge E. Gonzalez, a City College of New York engineering professor who is helping to lead a consortium of scientists from the United States and the Dominican Republic studying the phenomenon.\n\nOther lakes have grown, from melting glaciers and other factors, Mr. Gonzalez said, but \u201cthe growth rates of these two lakes in Hispaniola has no precedent.\u201d\n\nThe lakes, salty vestiges of an ancient oceanic channel known for their crocodiles and iguanas, have always had high and low periods, but researchers believe they have never before gotten this large. The waters began rising a decade ago, and now Enriquillo has nearly doubled in size to about 135 square miles, Mr. Gonzalez said, roughly the size of Atlanta, though relatively light rains in the past year have slowed its expansion. Azuei has grown nearly 40 percent in that time, to about 52 square miles, according to the consortium.\n\nThe scientists, partly financed by the National Science Foundation, are focusing on changing climate patterns as the main culprit, with a noted rise in rainfall in the area attributed to warming in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nIn reports, they have noted a series of particularly heavy storms in 2007 and 2008 that swamped the lakes and the watersheds that feed them, though other possible contributing factors are also being studied, including whether new underground springs have emerged.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about climate change adaptation, well, this is what\u2019s coming, if it\u2019s coming,\u201d said Yolanda Leon, a Dominican scientist working on the lake research.\n\nThe rise has taken a toll, particularly around Enriquillo, an area more populated than that around Azuei.\n\nThe government estimates that 40,000 acres of agricultural land have been lost, affecting several thousand families who have lost all or part of their only livelihood of yucca, banana and cattle farming. The town of Boca de Cachon at the lake\u2019s edge is in particular peril, with some houses already lost, and the government is bulldozing acres of land for new farms.\n\nA main highway to the Haitian border was flooded and had to be diverted, while another road around the perimeter of the lake now ends abruptly in the water.\n\nLocal residents are skeptical that the government will follow through, and they question whether the soil will be as good as the parcels near the lake that drew generations of farmers in the first place.\n\nOlgo Fernandez, the director of the country\u2019s hydraulic resources institute, waved off the criticism and said the government had carefully planned the new community and plots to ensure the area remains an agriculture hotbed. It will be completed this year, officials said, though on a recent afternoon there was much work left to be done.\n\n\u201cThese will be lands that will produce as well as, if not better than, the lands they previously had,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said.\n\nRow upon row of cookie-cutter, three-bedroom, cinder-block houses \u2014 537 in all \u2014 are being built in the new town, which will include a baseball field, church, schools, community center, parks, even a helicopter landing pad (\u201cfor visiting dignitaries,\u201d an official explained). Environmental controls will make it \u201cthe greenest town in the Dominican Republic,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Rafael Emilio de Luna, who is overseeing the work.\n\nFor now, though, at the ever-creeping edge of the lake, the ghostly trunks of dead palm trees mark submerged farms.\n\nJunior Moral Medina, 27, who lives in Boca, plans to move to the new community. He looked out on a recent day on an area where his 10-acre farm had been, now a pool of lake water studded with dead palms.\n\n\u201cWe have been worried the whole town would disappear,\u201d said Mr. Medina, who now works on the construction site for the new town. \u201cSome people at first did not want to leave this area, but the water kept rising and made everybody scared.\u201d\n\nResidents in other communities are growing impatient and worry they will not be compensated for their losses.\n\nEnrique Diaz Mendez has run a small grocery stand in Jaragua since losing half of his six acres of yucca and plantain crops to Enriquillo. \u201cWe are down to almost nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nJose Joaquin Diaz and his brother, Victor, grew up tending to the sheep, goats and cows of the family farm, but both left the Dominican Republic for the United States for better opportunity. Jose returned first, and three years ago Victor arrived, looking forward to the slower pace of life after working an array of jobs over 18 years in Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cWe told him about the lake, but he was shocked when he saw it,\u201d Jose recalled, tears welling with the memory.\n\nLater that night, Victor called his mother to express his dismay. The next morning he was found hanging in a relative\u2019s apartment in Santo Domingo where he was staying. \u201cIt is strange to see people fishing where we had the cows,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cVictor could not bear it.\u201d\n\nEzra Fieser contributed reporting from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on January 12, 2014, on page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Rising Tide Is a Mystery That Sinks Island Hopes.

      "source": "Two little-seen poems by the late Seamus Heaney are being collected for the first time in a new anthology about Dublin.\n\nPart of If Ever You Go, a \"map of Dublin in poetry and song\", the Heaney poems sit alongside works by Jonathan Swift, WB Yeats, James Joyce and more contemporary writers in a collection that is intended to \"explore, street by street, one of the world's most famous literary cities through the poems and songs it has inspired\", said publisher Dedalus Press.\n\nEditor and poet Pat Boran wrote to Heaney in early 2013 asking him if he would allow two previously uncollected poems, Dublin 4 and Beacons at Bealtaine, to be included in the anthology, as well as two other poems The Strand and Viking Dublin: Trial Pieces, which are already well-known. Ireland's Nobel literature laureate died in August last year.\n\nBeacons at Bealtaine was written by Heaney to mark the enlargement of the EU in May 2004, and sees the poet write that: \"Strangers were barbaroi to the Greek ear. / Now let the heirs of all who could not speak / The language, whose ba-babbling was unclear, // Come with their gift of tongues past each frontier / And find the answering voices that they seek.\"\n\n\"It extends a welcome to those who 'Come with their gifts of tongues past each frontier', not by imagining some designed or bland European esperanto but by reaching back, as he so often did, into the richness of his own inheritance, and recalling the 'bright water' at the etymological source of Dublin's Phoenix Park,\" said Boran of the poem. \"In this he was no doubt mindful of the fact that Dublin itself derives from the Irish 'Dubh Linn' or 'black pool', and his poem seems consciously to present a brighter vision of the city and its origins, and thereby of the wider parish or jurisdiction of the EU itself.\"\n\nBoran said that Heaney responded with his \"customary humour and warmth\" when finding that a proof of the book showed the villanelle represented as a single block, rather than five three-line, and one four-line, stanzas as he had intended it. \"Glad that the old beacons are getting a chance to burn again. But they need a draught or two between the lines \u2026 \" the poet told Boran.\n\nDublin 4, meanwhile, sees Heaney make a link \"between the here-and-now and the poet's early years, imagining a direct connection between the trains he observed in boyhood ('like promises being speedily withdrawn') and those that, in his suburban Dublin 4 adulthood, could be heard and seen not far from his house, all the range of promise and possibility of the past leading up to this particular present\", said Boran. The poem was originally contributed by Heaney to Poems on the DART, an echo of London's Poems on the Underground project.\n\nHeaney rarely wrote about Dublin, said Boran, and \"on more than one occasion Seamus wondered aloud about the relative lack of poems he wrote about or clearly set in Dublin, not chastising himself but with genuine curiosity\".\n\n\"Though his few Dublin poems are far from uninvolved in his adopted city's history, it is undoubtedly true that, to a great extent, his muse was more comfortable in a rural setting,\" added Boran. \"Indeed, there is a fitting analogy in the closing section of his most extensive Dublin poem, Viking Dublin: Trial Pieces, in which, after visiting what might be called the city's Viking shrines, the poem ends with a distinctly northern tone: 'Did you ever hear tell,' / said Jimmy Farrell, / 'of the skulls they have / in the city of Dublin?' Suddenly transported out of the city (perhaps back to rural Derry) it is as if, either in its past or present incarnation, Dublin is a place to be viewed, and reviewed, from a world in which Heaney had set his heart long before.\"\n\nJust published by Dedalus Press, If Ever You Go is the title chosen by Dublin's city council for its One City One Book project, which aims to get Dubliners reading one particular title during the month of April. \"There are songs and ballads from the city's colonial past, verses by leaders of the 1916 Rising, and portraits of the modern city with its Spire and Luas tram, its Celtic Tiger 'prosperity' and its post-Celtic Tiger challenges,\" said the council, which has previously chosen titles for its city-wide read including Joyce's short story collection Dubliners and Joseph O'Connor's novel Ghost Light, and which has a host of events lined up to celebrate the anthology this month."

Moscow has denied that, saying that Russians who joined the mutiny did so as private citizens.\n\nPressed to comment about the agreement on the withdrawal of foreign fighters, Russian Ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Zurabov, who represented Moscow in the talks, said that \"those whom we call mercenaries are present on both sides.\" \"This issue needs to be solved, and we will deal with it,\" he said, adding that the OSCE would control the pullout.\n\nHeidi Tagliavini, OSCE's envoy in the talks, said that the group's monitors will be deployed to the buffer zone to monitor the cease-fire.\n\nThe negotiators, however, have left aside the most explosive issue -- the future status of the rebel regions.\n\nThe insurgency in the mostly Russian-speaking Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine flared up after the ouster of Ukraine's former pro-Russian president in February and Russia's annexation of Crimea the following month.\n\nIn April, the rebels seized government buildings in the two provinces and declared them independent. They fought government troops to a standstill in five months of fighting that have killed more than 3,000 people and devastated the regions that formed Ukraine's industrial heartland.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis has pushed Russia-West relations to their lowest point since the Cold War. Faced with several rounds of Western sanctions that badly hurt the Russian economy, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has pushed for a peace deal that would ease Western pressure while protecting Moscow's interests in Ukraine.\n\nAs part of a compromise to end the hostilities, the Ukrainian parliament this week passed a law giving a broad autonomy to the areas controlled by the rebels, including the power to hold local elections and form their own police force.\n\nAlexander Zakharchenko, the leader of rebels in Donetsk, said after the talks that Ukraine and the rebels have conflicting interpretations of the law and the talks should continue.\n\nIn Donetsk, the largest rebel-held city in east Ukraine, the separatists held a city-wide cleanup day Friday, sending prisoners out to help remove the debris that has piled up after months of shelling.\n\nThroughout the cease-fire, periods of peace have been interrupted by intermittent gunfire. The same was true Friday, when the Donetsk city council said in a statement that one person was killed by shelling during the night. Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told journalists in Kiev that two servicemen were killed in the past day during the fighting.\n\nThe streets were quiet Friday as the rebels called for a cleanup. In one school that was shelled in late August, four Ukrainian prisoners guarded by armed rebels were sweeping up debris."

But old Washington hands know to go to smaller parties that will be well done.\u201d\n\nOr as Diana McLellan, the retired society columnist put it, \u201cPeople spend a lot of money and time getting dressed to go, but even the best official balls are enormous scrums.\u201d In particular, she remembers the one (and only one) given by Jimmy Carter, which was called a \u201cparty\u201d rather than a \u201cball\u201d to assuage recessionary guilt. It was in Union Station before it was renovated.\n\n\u201cAnd all there was to eat were peanuts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like going to hell.\u201d\n\nWell, nobody ever said Washington was an easy town. That\u2019s especially true during fiscally tricky times, which may explain the difficulties that the president\u2019s inaugural committee had raising $50 million for festivities, after the most expensive presidential race in history.\n\nNor is the capital in a particularly jolly mood \u2014 what with all the fiscal drama, contested appointments and a Congress so embittered that it makes the one depicted in \u201cLincoln\u201d look like a garden club. And let\u2019s not overlook the fact that second inaugurations should be more subdued, \u201ca little bit like a second wedding\u201d according to The Washington Post Magazine.\n\nBut never mind. Even with fewer attendees expected, and the news this week that the Washington power couple Tony and Heather Podesta are divorcing, it\u2019s still a festive week for all kinds of party animals, especially of the Democratic persuasion. Here\u2019s a selective and highly curated list.\n\nThe power brokers atop the invitation should be a tip off \u2014 Buffy and Bill Cafritz, Ann and Vernon Jordan, Vicki and Roger Sant \u2014 for one of the most coveted tickets in town. Their 2009 edition was so star-studded \u2014 Tim Geithner here, Tom Brokaw, Ben Bradlee and Eli Broad there \u2014 that the Clintons couldn\u2019t make it 10 feet past the door. And at least one movie star, an organizer claimed, was turned away. It wasn\u2019t Glenn Close. She was inside.\n\nDolley Madison Ballroom at the Madison, 1177 15th Street, NW; Sunday, 9:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Invitation only.\n\nWith tickets starting at $10,000 a pair, expect the Creative Coalition\u2019s Inaugural Ball to attract high-rollers and notable names, even if not quite like in 2009. The Goo Goo Dolls play this time for guests including Paula Abdul, Eric Stonestreet, John Leguizamo, Giancarlo Esposito and Johnny Galecki. Oh, and Tim Daly, too. He\u2019s the president \u2014 of the Creative Coalition, that is.\n\nHarman Center for the Arts, 610 F Street, NW; Monday from 9 p.m. Tickets from $10,000 a pair.\n\nMichelle Obama and Jill Biden headline the Kid\u2019s Inaugural concert, hosted by the presidential inauguration committee and held in honor of military families. Expected guests include Alicia Keys, the cast of \u201cGlee,\u201d Katy Perry and Marc Anthony. Mindless Behavior (the boy band) is also on the roster. A prediction of the days to follow?\n\nWalter E. Washington Convention Center, 801 Mount Vernon Place, NW; Saturday from TBD. Invitation only.\n\n4. DON\u2019T MESS WITH TEXAS\n\nWhile there are only two official balls, there\u2019s no shortage of state society balls.And veterans know that these state balls have more food, drink and chances to hobnob with members of Congress. The standout is the Black Tie & Boots Inaugural Ball, sponsored by the Texas State Society of Washington, which promises six stages with performers, and truckloads of Texan food and drink. Gowns for women and tuxedos and boots for men suggested. Cowboy hats optional.\n\nGaylord National Resort and Convention Center (National Harbor, Maryland); Saturday, 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. $250 members; $275 for nonmembers (texasstatesociety.org).\n\nGoogle is toning things down from its 2009 inaugural bash, which featured dancing, a game room and big names like Ben Affleck, John Cusack and Craig Newmark (of Craigslist). This time, the search engine (which has a big legislative agenda) is partnering with Elle and the Center for American Progress for a Leading Women in Washington brunch, toasting the record number of new congresswomen, many of whom are expected to attend. No binders full of women here, just the real thing.\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Eighth and F Streets, NW; Sunday, noon to 3 p.m.: Invitation only.\n\n6. LATINO VOTES AND VOICES\n\nLast fall, activists took the Kennedy Center to task for only including two Hispanics \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Chita Rivera \u2014 among its 186 honorees since 1978. Now a committee has been formed to address the issue. By happy coincidence (or is it?), Latinos take center stage for \u201c In Performance at the Kennedy Center,\u201d hosted by Eva Longoria and others. Lineup includes Antonio Banderas, Rosario Dawson, Ra\u00fal Esparza, Jos\u00e9 Feliciano, Melanie Griffith, George Lopez, Rita Moreno and Ms. Rivera. Picante!\n\nKennedy Center Opera House, 2700 F Street, NW; Sunday from 7 p.m. Tickets, $150 to $300.\n\nAt the 2009 Peace Ball, Joan Baez sang \u201cForever Young.\u201d This time around, sentiments may not be as hopeful. Still the ball, which is organized by Busboys and Poets, a much-loved Washington community bookstore and cafe, offers this cynical and compromising town a progressive and idealistic vision of tomorrow. Guests include Angela Davis, Amy Goodman, Ralph Nader, Alice Walker, Marian Wright Edelman and Danny Glover. Moby spins, too.\n\nArena Stage at the Mead Center, 1101 6th Street, SW; Sunday, 7:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tickets, $135, sold out.\n\n8. DEMS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN\n\nNancy Pelosi, always gracious at parties, will be the main attraction at the 2013 Speaker\u2019s Cabinet Inauguration Luncheon and Concert, hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But Cyndi Lauper, in town to perform at the Human Rights Campaign LGBT celebration the following night as well, will be the entertainment (along with John Legend).\n\nItalian Embassy, 3000 Whitehaven Street, NW; Sunday at 12:30 p.m. Invitation only\n\nEven yogis are getting into the spirit of things with the Yoga Ball, sponsored by Off the Mat Into the World, and Yoga Votes, which promotes voting between oms and sun salutations. The evening includes asana yoga, a vegetarian dinner, music and meditation. Dress: spiritual.\n\nSt. Francis Hall, 1340 Quincy Street, NE; Sunday from 4 p.m.; $50 in advance, $60 at the door.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will be out and about, and no doubt at the Illinois Society State Ball on Saturday night. Mr. Emanuel is also hosting a Chicago-style after-party at the Hamilton (600 14th Street, NW). Co-hosts include Matthew Barzun (former United States ambassador to Sweden), Eva Longoria, Jim Messina and Julianna Smoot. Around the corner at the W hotel (515 15th Street NW), Electronic Arts is hosting an after party to promote an organization called Learn. Build.Create. It\u2019s with Pharrell Williams, John Legend and Malin Akerman, along with Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles. Both are invitation only, with doors opening at 11 p.m \u2013 unimaginably late \u2013 by D.C. standards."

      "source": "When it comes to holiday windows, Barneys New York knows how to up the ante. Last year, its flagship store invited shoppers and sidewalk gawkers to peek into Lady Gaga\u2019s twisted, cartoonish version of Santa\u2019s workshop. Two years ago, the department store celebrated food and its kin with elaborate culinary windows replete with edible food. And in 2009, Barneys New York creative director Simon Doonan gave SNL the royal treatment for the holiday treatment with larger-than-life 3-D caricatures of famous cast members in honor of the show\u2019s upcoming 35th anniversary.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s no exaggeration that Barneys got Disneyfied. That adjective is usually a pejorative, but in this case, it\u2019s accurate. Barneys CEO Mark Lee unveiled its holiday 2012 windows on Nov. 14 with some help from Disney CEO Bob Iger, Sarah Jessica Parker, Tinker Bell and Minnie Mouse. After a brief introduction, LED screens situated on the lower two levels of the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade showed \u201cElectric Holiday,\u201d a short animated film that follows Minnie Mouse as she longingly window shops at Barneys, only to find herself eventually walking the runway along with some of her best cartoon friends. Adults will appreciate the remarkably spot-on drawings of Ed Filipowski and Linda Evangelista, while children will delight in the fact that it is truly a Disney production.\n\n(MORE: I Like Ike: Election Fashion from 1952)\n\nWhen the Disney-Barneys holiday window partnership was announced in August, expectations were set as high as the tallest spire of Cinderella\u2019s castle. That bubble of anticipation was punctured slightly by the highly stylized image of a stretched-and-thinned Minnie Mouse that WWD ran in late October. Parent groups rallied against the transformation of an already-petite children\u2019s icon that they argued would set a bad example by becoming too thin. Barneys defended the illustration, stating that it was taken out of context.\n\nDisney and Barneys released a joint statement to New York Daily News explaining their skinny Minnie.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened that activists have repeatedly tried to distort a lighthearted holiday project in order to draw media attention to themselves,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThey have deliberately ignored previously released information clearly stating this promotion is a three-minute \u2018moving art\u2019 video featuring traditional Minnie Mouse in a dreamlike sequence set in Paris where she briefly walks the runway as a model and then happily awakens as her normal self (above) wearing the very same designer dress from the fashion show.\u201d\n\nOnce the dust settled, all eyes were trained on the Madison Avenue flagship store.

But, here\u2019s the thing. Most of the \u201cdeals\u201d aren\u2019t really deals at all.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that prices on those two highly hyped shopping days are mostly beaten in the weeks following. One analysis, by the folks who run the shopping app ShopAdvisor, found that nearly half the prices are actually better right now than they will be on Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be some sort of real deal you can chase. Many of the biggest retailers will dangle sale items that are limited in availability. They\u2019ll usually disclose that (they have to). So, a dozen people will get a big TV for half the regular price. Everyone else can shop the other, not-nearly-as-good sales.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re bent on scoring great deals, it\u2019s vital to know the prices. Just because one store\u2019s ad trumpets \u201cBest Price of the Season,\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t get it cheaper elsewhere. There are a boatload of sites that help shoppers track prices and hunt for deals. If you really want that TV for the best price, see what the best price really is.\n\nMost of the fliers for the Holy Grail of shopping days are already available online. If you spot a product of interest, check its price at other retailers. But be sure you\u2019re doing an apples-to-apples comparison. It\u2019s not unusual for a retailer to offer a slightly different product with a very similar name and model number to make it appear as if the product is more discounted than it really is.\n\nThat\u2019s important if you\u2019re planning to use a price protection feature on a credit card. If there\u2019s a price drop, you\u2019ll only be able to claim the difference between the price you paid and the lower price if it\u2019s the same product.\n\nIf you feel you must engage in shopping\u2019s crazy week, it works best if you have a thought-out, well-researched plan. Otherwise, hang tight and rest assured a little waiting might just yield an even better price. And that doesn\u2019t mean waiting until the very last minute."

      "source": "Last weekend China announced a change in its currency policy, a move clearly intended to head off pressure from the United States and other countries at this weekend\u2019s G-20 summit meeting. Unfortunately, the new policy doesn\u2019t address the real issue, which is that China has been promoting its exports at the rest of the world\u2019s expense.\n\nIn fact, far from representing a step in the right direction, the Chinese announcement was an exercise in bad faith \u2014 an attempt to exploit U.S. restraint. To keep the rhetorical temperature down, the Obama administration has used diplomatic language in its efforts to persuade the Chinese government to end its bad behavior. Now the Chinese have responded by seizing on the form of American language to avoid dealing with the substance of American complaints. In short, they\u2019re playing games.\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on, we need to get back to the basics of the situation.\n\nChina\u2019s exchange-rate policy is neither complicated nor unprecedented, except for its sheer scale. It\u2019s a classic example of a government keeping the foreign-currency value of its money artificially low by selling its own currency and buying foreign currency. This policy is especially effective in China\u2019s case because there are legal restrictions on the movement of funds both into and out of the country, allowing government intervention to dominate the currency market.\n\nAnd the proof that China is, in fact, keeping the value of its currency, the renminbi, artificially low is precisely the fact that the central bank is accumulating so many dollars, euros and other foreign assets \u2014 more than $2 trillion worth so far. There have been all sorts of calculations purporting to show that the renminbi isn\u2019t really undervalued, or at least not by much. But if the renminbi isn\u2019t deeply undervalued, why has China had to buy around $1 billion a day of foreign currency to keep it from rising?\n\nThe effect of this currency undervaluation is twofold: it makes Chinese goods artificially cheap to foreigners, while making foreign goods artificially expensive to the Chinese. That is, it\u2019s as if China were simultaneously subsidizing its exports and placing a protective tariff on its imports.\n\nThis policy is very damaging at a time when much of the world economy remains deeply depressed. In normal times, you could argue that Chinese purchases of U.S. bonds, while distorting trade, were at least supplying us with cheap credit \u2014 and you could argue that it wasn\u2019t China\u2019s fault that we used that credit to inflate a vast, destructive housing bubble. But right now we\u2019re awash in cheap credit; what\u2019s lacking is sufficient demand for goods and services to generate the jobs we need. And China, by running an artificial trade surplus, is aggravating that problem.\n\nThis does not, by the way, mean that China gains from its currency policy. The undervalued renminbi is good for politically influential export companies. But these companies hoard cash rather than passing on the benefits to their workers, hence the recent wave of strikes. Meanwhile, the weak renminbi creates inflationary pressures and diverts a huge fraction of China\u2019s national income into the purchase of foreign assets with a very low rate of return.\n\nSo where does last week\u2019s policy announcement fit into all this? Well, China has allowed the renminbi to rise \u2014 but barely. As of Thursday, the currency was only about half a percent higher than its typical level before the announcement. And all indications are that watching the future movement of the renminbi will be like watching paint dry: Chinese officials are still making statements denying that a rise in their currency will do anything to reduce trade imbalances, and prices in the forward market, in which traders agree to exchange currencies at various points in the future, suggest a rise of only about 2 percent in the renminbi by the end of this year. This is basically a joke.\n\nWhat the Chinese have done, they claim, to increase the \u201cflexibility\u201d of their exchange rate: it\u2019s moving around more from day to day than it did in the past, sometimes up, sometimes down.\n\nOf course, Chinese policy makers know perfectly well that although U.S. officials have indeed called for more currency flexibility, that was just a diplomatic euphemism for what America, and the world, wants (and has the right to demand): a much stronger renminbi. Having the currency bob up or down slightly makes no difference to the fundamentals.\n\nSo what comes next? China\u2019s government is clearly trying to string the rest of us along, putting off action until something \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say what \u2014 comes up.\n\nThat\u2019s not acceptable. China needs to stop giving us the runaround and deliver real change. And if it refuses, it\u2019s time to talk about trade sanctions."

      "source": "What kind of police service do we want? This question was posed a few years ago by Sir Ian (now Lord) Blair, the former Metropolitan Police commissioner, in his Dimbleby Lecture for the BBC. He quoted Robert Peel, who founded the Met in 1829: \"The police are the public and the public are the police\". The citizens of Britain, said Lord Blair, must decide what they want their police to do. A laudable concept indeed \u2013 yet the general public is routinely excluded from a debate that is conducted exclusively among police chiefs, politicians and others in the criminal justice elite.\n\nIf the rest of us were to be consulted, what would our answer be? For a start, most people would consider the police to be a force rather than a service \u2013 not because they want it to be aggressive or brutal but because its job is to keep order and uphold the law, not behave like another community agency or a branch of social work. We want it to be visible, accountable, sensible and local. The principal duty of the police remains, as Peel set out, the prevention of crime. Of course there are pressures on the modern force that were not around 40 or 50 years ago, such as international terrorism, cyber crime and drug smuggling. But there are specialist agencies to deal with these that could and should be expanded.\n\nIf there has been one overriding public desire in recent years, it is that the police should focus on stopping crime before it happens and preventing disorder when it does. To that end there are far more police officers than at any time since Peel \u2013 around 140,000, compared with just 100,000 in the early 1970s. So why have the Government's attempts to make the police more responsive to this public mood caused such consternation? The key reform is to have directly elected police and crime commissioners working alongside chief constables. But the latter don't like the idea.\n\nSir Hugh Orde, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), told his annual conference yesterday that the proposals \"run the risk of compromising the safety of citizens for reasons of expediency\". Sir Hugh said this was the greatest change in police governance for 180 years, but we really only need to go back to the mid-1960s to see the last big upheaval. This was when policing started to become much more centralised, as governments moved to create fewer and bigger forces. The Police Act of 1964 cut the number of constabularies outside London from 117 to 49. Further reforms reduced the total in England and Wales to the current level of 44. The consequence was that policing became increasingly remote from the public and the power of chief officers and of the Home Office grew.\n\nAround this time, the so-called tripartite system was developed, ostensibly to give equal powers to Whitehall, chief constables and local authorities. In reality, it emasculated councils and the concept of operational independence was used to enhance the power of the police chiefs still further. The 1996 Police Act cut the size of the police authorities, scrapped elections to them and transferred control over budgets to the chiefs. The Home Office took powers to draw up national police priorities and further centralisation took place in 2002.\n\nIn other words, the history of policing over the past 50 years or so has been a long march away from the community, away from the streets and away from the priorities that most people would set. And the police would like to go further still. They still hanker after the stillborn plan of Charles Clarke when he was home secretary to merge forces into 17 regional super-constabularies.\n\nYet one thing we have learnt since the 1960s is that while mergers in the private sector bring economies of scale, in the public they result in even greater costs. More than that, the progressive creation of ever-larger police units has merely exacerbated popular dissatisfaction. People no longer feel, in the way that they used to, that it is \"their\" force. Where once officers lived in their communities in police houses, they now commute into work; where once police stations opened 24 hours a day, they are now closed at night or have been centralised in a county town.\n\nSir Hugh rightly praised the British impartial policing model as one \"revered across the world\", but it is a model whose essential element \u2013 its local roots \u2013 has been eroded over the past half-century. It is unfortunate that attempts to reverse this trend are happening just as the public sector has to make spending cuts and with police officers feeling the strain on their pay and pensions. Finding good candidates to put themselves forward as potential police commissioners will also prove difficult and controversial. With so many battles already under way, pressure is mounting for an NHS-style U-turn. Sir Hugh said it would be sensible for ministers to pause, reflect and \"listen to the professionals\" \u2013 as if they haven't said enough.\n\nDoubtless there are some changes, such as the setting up of a National Crime Agency, that might merit a rethink if there is uncertainty over its precise role. But Sir Hugh's dire warnings of a grave threat to public safety cannot be used to stymie the core reforms to governance that would be needed even if the country was awash with money. Policing needs to be reconnected to the people, not further estranged from them. It is no good top cops like Lord Blair and Sir Hugh asking the public to say what they want from the police if they just keep ignoring the answer."

Titled Life in a Day, the experiment is being sponsored by the online clip site and involves directors Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) and Ridley Scott (Robin Hood, Gladiator), who will executive-produce.\n\nThe end result, with entries selected by Macdonald and a team of editors, will premiere at next year's Sundance Film Festival and will be available free on YouTube. The submission deadline is July 31, and a video gallery is scheduled to be posted in August.\n\n\"YouTube wanted to do something to mark its fifth anniversary and decided on a film,\" says Macdonald, whose non-fiction work includes the 2003 mountain-climbing adventure Touching the Void. \"I came up with an idea that appealed to me as a student of documentaries, one that would only be possible with the new technology on the Web.\"\n\nWhy July 24? \"Because it is symbolic and practical,\" he says. The date \"stands for 24/7, or 7/24.\" As for timing, \"it's after the World Cup, an enormous affair in many countries, but before the August holidays. And it's a Saturday, when people might have more time.\"\n\nMacdonald would rather not have thousands of videos of cute animal tricks, popular fare on YouTube, though he would not discount them out of hand. His hope: \"that people capture everyday life, from the banal to the important. It could be a journey to work, brushing their teeth, bathing children at night \u2014 something of significance to those who are filming.\"\n\nHe estimates that about 10,000 submissions will end up being uploaded, including those shot on several hundred cameras sent out to areas in South America, Africa and Asia that lack Internet access. \"We want to lose the digital divide.\"\n\nThe final film will run about 70 or 80 minutes. \"We don't want to make it a collage,\" says Macdonald, who will focus on 20 to 30 \"star performers\" with a few seconds culled from a couple hundred more. \"We want it to cohere and be meaningful.\"\n\nUltimately, the goal is to deliver \"something relevant about what it is to be alive on July 24, a kind of a time capsule.\" If all goes well, it could become a recurring event.\n\nFull details can be found at youtube.com/lifeinaday.

O'Brien, the president of the Securities Industry Association, said the S.E.C.'s approach of ''benevolent oversight'' was ''exactly the right thing.''\n\nSome members of Congress, however, are not that pleased with the slow progress. Last September, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation released a five-year status report on the national market system that was critical of the S.E.C.'s slowness in removing anticompetitive barriers.\n\nBut the chairman of that subcommittee, Representative Bob Eckhardt, Democrat of Texas, who has taken an active interest in the S.E.C., was defeated in a re-election effort last November and the future interest of that committee in prodding the S.E.C. on a national market is uncertain.\n\nThe aim of a national market system is to assure the best possible price on customers' orders regardless of where they are executed. To work properly, some experts say, the system must electronically link the various stock exchanges, provide adequate disclosure and communications between the participants, and offer sufficient opportunities for off-the-board transactions, whether or not traders are members of the exchange.\n\nRemoving the monopolistic off-board restrictions - such as the New York Stock Exchange Rule 390, which forces member firms to bring their orders to the specialist on the floor - has always been and remains a major hurdle.\n\nLast June, the commission adopted a rule, 19c-3, that weakens 390 by giving member firms the option of taking orders for some 130 selected stocks to exchange specialists or executing orders within their own firms. But Mr. O'Brien contends that some sort of electronic ''linkage'' is needed in order to assess the effect of 19c-3.\n\nSuch linkage is likely within the next few months, when an automated tie-in is expected between the Intermarket Trading System, or I.T.S., an electronic link of the Big Board with regional exchanges, and the NASDAQ system, which handles the over-the-counter markets."

      "source": "Pope Benedict XVI returns to his native Germany this week in his first foreign trip since succeeding Pope John Paul II in April. It was his predecessor who first inaugurated World Youth Day, a five-day Catholic festival expected to draw over 24,000 to the streets of Cologne. The new pope will be closely scrutinized as he seeks to reach out to young people and revitalize the church in Europe.\n\nJohn Allen , a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter who is currently in Cologne, Germany, will be online Friday, Aug. 19, at 1 p.m. ET to discuss the Pope's trip to World Youth Day.\n\nFalls Church, Va.: Sort of a divine coincidence that the preselected location of the new Pope's first appearance at a world youth day rally (a recurring event initiated by the old Pope) is in his native Germany? I will be curious to see what sort of enthusiasm the host country generates for one of their own. I was in Germany some years ago and attended Sunday Mass in an urban church. I may be over generalizing, but it was very sparsely attended and rather lifeless, unlike the packed Sunday Masses typical in my vibrant Arlington, Virginia diocese. What do you think are the chances of this Pope bringing vitality and growth to western European Catholicism? He seems to lack the spiritual and numerical underpinning of support Pope John Paul II received from his Polish countrymen.\n\nJohn Allen: Yeah, the official estimate from the German bishops is that 18 percent of Catholics here go to Mass; most Germans I talk to say that's too high. Certainly the enthusiasm levels here have been tremendous, but remember that World Youth Day participants come from 193 nations, so it's not necessarily a reflection of the German situation. On the other hand, the German press seems astonished at how well things have gone so far -- the Frankfurter Allgemeine today called it \"nothing short of a miracle\" in terms of the turnout and passion. The big question is what long-term impact it will have, and obviously that remains to be seen.\n\nStamford, Conn.: Pope Bennie's visit to the German Synangogue was a thoughtful statement.\n\nThe previous statements by Vatican officials (about Israel) were more ignorant than malevolent. Bennie helped write many of the Vatican positions issued by JPII, so I expect to see more outreach to Jews and Christians.\n\nWill the Pope visit a mosque? How will the Muslim world respond?\n\nJohn Allen: As you probably know, John Paul became the first pope to visit a mosque, the Grand Ommayid Mosque in Damascus, in 2001. (Great story about me almost getting killed by the Syrian security, which I'll save for another time). If as expected Benedict travels to Istanbul to meet the Patriarch of Constantinople, it's hard to imagine he wouldn't also schedule a trip to a mosque. On the whole, people expect Benedict to take a slightly more \"hawkish\" line with Muslims, insisting on reciprocity -- if Muslim immigrants get religious freedom in the West, then we want it for Christians in majority Muslim states.\n\nBaltimore, Md.: Pope Benedict XVI has as one of his goals, reaching the Jews of Europe. Interestingly enough, his former position in \"The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith\" was once known as \"The Inquisition\". His admiration of Vatican I tactics is a direct threat to the Jewish population. Has no one questioned why the present and former Pontiffs have been from the two countries that sought to exterminate Jews in Europe?\n\nJohn Allen: Well, both of those popes have. They tend to believe that God wanted sons of Poland and Germany to be the ones to try to heal these historical wounds -- that was the logic of John Paul's 2000 visit to Israel, for example. How well they've done that is for others to judge. What Benedict said today in the synagogue is that we've got to be able to talk honestly to one another about our differences.\n\nBaltimore Md.: What are the pope's goals -- both immediate and longer-term -- in choosing that event in Cologne, Germany, as his first foreign trip?\n\nJohn Allen: Benedict XVI didn't choose this trip -- John Paul II did, back in 2002, at the end of World Youth Day in Toronto. In that sense, Benedict's goal is the same as John Paul's -- to try to inspire young people to live Catholic faith to the full, especially in the ultra-secularized environment of Germany and Western Europe. Beyond that, however, he also several other objectives. He added to the trip a visit to the Cologne synagogue, which happened today at noon, as a way of advancing the Catholic/Jewish relationship. He also added a meeting with Muslims tomorrow, as a way of trying to figure out where to take that relationship. And he has an ecumenical session with Protestants that's going on right now, in order to pursue Christian unity -- in other words, putting the divided Christian churches back together.\n\nDetroit, Michigan: No matter what gestures the current pope makes toward other faiths, his record as the Vatican's doctrine expert (as Cardinal Ratzinger) will make other faiths suspicious. The \"Dominus Iesus\" which he authored was not the type of document that brings faiths toward understanding and compassion toward one another. In fact, Cardinal Ratzinger at the time stated that theologians were \"manipulating and going beyond the limits of tolerance when they put all religions on the same plane\".\n\nI don't think the Vatican today is attuned to the sensitivities of other faiths. Another example, was the canonization of Edith Stein. She did not die in the Holocaust as a result of her Catholicism: it was because she was born as a Jew and the Nazis viewed her as such. It is probably too much to hope that the Vatican will honor a Catholic who lost their life at that time for having saved jews (that is what Israel honors as \"righteous gentiles\").\n\nJohn Allen: You rightly point to a number of serious, and as yet unresolved, in the Catholic Church's relationship with other faiths, perhaps especially Judaism. Yet I was at the Cologne synagogue today, and what I saw convinced me that people on both sides genuinely want healing and better ties. When Rabbi Netanel Teitelbaum said he was extending his hand to Benedict as a sign of peace, the place erupted. As the pope was leaving, a man wearing the traditional Jewish yarmulke and tallit sprinted towards his car and planted a kiss on the window. Such gestures tell me that despite the challenges out there, hope endures.\n\nJohn Allen: The missing word in that first sentence is \"issues.\"\n\nFalls Church, Va.: This is probably an unfair question because Pope JPII stands as a towering figure right now, but how would you rate Pope B's charm and persuasion against JPII's? What strengths will Pope B likely utilize to spread the Word?\n\nJohn Allen: While Benedict does not have John Paul's populist touch, he is a strikingly clear, limpid thinker, where John Paul's prose could sometimes be a bit dense. Further, Benedict is a genuinely gracious, humble man, and my experience is that people find those attractive qualities. The broader world may not be wowed as they were by JPII, but I suspect that serious people will find it impossible to ignore Benedict XVI, whether they agree with him or not.\n\nChicago, Ill.: Could you give your opinion - albeit highly subjective - concerning the following: the extent to which the German people in Cologne are reacting to Pope Benedict with affection, as opposed to open or muted hostility?\n\nJohn Allen: My sense is that the crowds have been large and genuinely affectionate, though bear in mind that the majority are not German -- the largest delegation is actually from Italy, with more than 100,000, and there are 25,000 Americans here. Many of the participants in World Youth Day are already involved, committed Catholics who would be pumped up to be in the presence of any pope. For most of the youth, they love seeing the pope, but what they really get from WYD is connection with other young people like themselves. Many feel like a minority back home, and here they get reinforcement and new energy.\n\nUSA: I read some comments suggesting that the current pope intends to keep a lower profile (including traveling less) than John Paul II in an effort to re-focus the attention of the faithful away from the person of the pope and toward Christ.\n\nI read this as an implied criticism of the previous pope.\n\nJohn Allen: I think your reading of Benedict's style is correct -- he wants the focus to be squarely on the office and the message, not the man. But I personally don't read that as a criticism of John Paul II. I think it's rather a recognition that John Paul had a unique charisma that brought new prestige to the papacy, but the risk is creating a cult of personality that ultimately distracts people from the core of the faith. You see here in Cologne a less theatrical style, based more on words than gestures, which is fascinating for those of us in the pencil press, though a little frustrating for my colleagues in TV!\n\nDetroit, Mich: The Roman Catholic Church is largely irrelevant. How many priests have been charged with sexual abuse? More than three thousand? If three thousand Republican politicians were charged with sexually abusing children, the Republican Party would cease to exist. Same for the Democrats.\n\nBut the Catholic Church just goes on and on and on...\n\nJohn Allen: I certainly understand your frustration ... though, for fairness' sake, it should be recalled that the figure of accused priests covers a time span of more than fifty years, representing slightly more than four percent of priests who served during that time. Even one priest is obviously too many, and given the numbers, it's clear there was a systemic problem, but it would be equally unfair to paint with too broad a brush. As for irrelevance, all I can say is that the roughly 1 million or so youth here in Cologne don't seem to think so. Perhaps they represent a minority of youth around the world, but it strikes most observers as a fairly dynamic and impressive minority.\n\nAustin, Tex.: I saw some interviews with some of the young people. Of course the people who spoke may not have been representative, but it was very clear that even in this self-selecting group, a lot of those kids don't take the Pope's stand on social issues (contraception, homosexuality, etc.) very seriously.\n\nAnd they're presumably a lot more sympathetic to the Church's teaching than the young people of Western Europe in general.\n\nI see trouble brewing. More specifically, I think the Church in Western Europe is basically finished.\n\nI assume you disagree. Can you convince me?\n\nJohn Allen: Well, it's not my role to agree or disagree, and certainly the numbers can be read to support your conclusion -- declining Mass attendance rates, declining numbers of priests, virtually no influence on public life, etc. (Though there are of course exceptions to all of those trends). I think what Pope Benedict has in mind is what he's called Christianity as a \"creative minority\" -- it may no longer be a mass phenomenon, but if it can generate a core of dedicated, passionate believers, it may still be able to exercise an outsized impact on the culture. I suppose it's that core one sees here in Cologne. You're quite right, many of these youth may have different ideas on some specific issues, but by and large they seem genuinely enthusiastic about the church and their faith. What that translates into when they go home, of course, is a different question.\n\nJohn Allen: I might note for anyone who's interested that I'm filing daily reports from Cologne, which are available at http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/\n\nwashingtonpost.com: Thanks to all who participated.\n\nEditor's Note: Washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions."

As of Friday, the site remained a scruffy vacant lot.\n\nSo far, the city\u2019s Department of Design and Construction has spent nearly $1 million to hire not one, but two architects: Karlsberger Architecture and Alexander Gorlin, records show. After their plan was approved in 2008, the national fiscal crisis put the project on hold.\n\nAfter three years, the original contract expired, so the city wound up paying the firms $990,589 for an unused design.\n\nReal estate photos of this vacant lot where the new controversial 40th Precinct will be built, February 19, 2016 at E. 149th St. and St. Ann's Avenue in the Bronx, New York.\n\nIn 2013, the plan was revived and the city requested proposals from seven architect firms.\n\nA Danish company known for its dramatic designs, Bjarke Ingels Group, was awarded a \u201cmaster contract\u201d for multiple projects of up to $10 million, including up to $3.8 million for the 40th Precinct. As of Friday Bjarke Ingels had been paid $1 million.\n\nLast week, city Design and Construction officials presented Bjarke Ingels\u2019 plan to the Public Arts Commission, an obscure agency that must sign off on anything built on city land. The commission gave the new plan preliminary approval.\n\nRenderings of the design depict a huge, intimidating, gunmetal-gray fortress consisting of a stack of concrete blocks that resemble something out of \u201cRobocop.\u201d The facades facing the street have no windows.\n\nArchitect Gorlin, whose more traditional plans were originally approved by the Public Arts Commission back in 2008, questioned why the city would want to build such an alienating facility in a community wracked by persistent crime.\n\n\u201cWith what\u2019s going on between the police and the community, they put forth something that looks like a bunker?\u201d Gorllin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of money and time from every angle.\u201d\n\nThe NYPD ultimately embraced the new design, deeming that the old plan did not address new requirements for sustainability and the department\u2019s desire to improve community interaction with police.\n\nThe 40th Precinct is in Mott Haven, where 24% of the population is black and 72% is Hispanic. It\u2019s one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York, reporting a 24% spike in major crimes such as murder, rape, robbery and felony assault in 2015 from the previous year.\n\nThat compares with a 1.6% drop in crime citywide and ranks the 40th with the worst crime spike in the city in 2015.\n\nAt first, the NYPD wanted to use the already-approved Karlsberger/Gorlin design. In an Aug. 4, 2014, internal email obtained by The News, Detective Daniel Diehl of the capital construction unit wrote to Design and Construction, \u201cThe need to redesign the project is not necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis project is important to the department and the mandate I have been given is to \u2018get it completed as quickly as possible and stay within budget,\u2019 \u201d Diehl wrote. \u201cFor a (variety) of reasons, many of the department\u2019s projects have exceeded the design and construction schedule as well as the original budget. This is one of (the) reasons the department wants to use the previously approved schematic design.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Vincent Grippo, NYPD deputy commissioner of management and budget, admitted that initially the department wanted to use the Gorlin plan to save time and money, but Design and Construction made it clear it wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nHe said the NYPD ultimately embraced the new design, deeming that the old plan did not address new requirements for sustainability and the department\u2019s desire to improve community interaction with police.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now looking at ways to engage the community,\u201d Grippo said. \u201cWe are doing something we have not done anywhere, ever. We\u2019re incorporating a community space. It will be a place where the community can come and engage with the police.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, construction officials said they have yet to hire a contractor but have set a start date for construction at \u201cearly 2017.\u201d Completion date is expected in \u201clate 2019\u201d \u2014 11 years after the project was first proposed."

For political junkies, though, this is the moment of peak entertainment: a half dozen candidates colliding into each other like bumper cars, and the utter\u2013and rather self-conscious\u2013volatility of the voters in the early primary states.\n\nSo, between now and the New Hampshire primary, I\u2019ll be posting every day, holidays included\u2013trying to sense the nano-wrinkles in the zeitgeist, keeping track of mood swings in the campaign, which can be abrupt and violent, especially as we approach the final days.\n\nThere\u2019s a debate tonight in Iowa, broadcast by ABC at 9pm Eastern time,which should be huge\u2013the first since the Newt surge began, the first without Herman Cain clotting the stage and also, unfortunately, the first without Jon Huntsman, since he\u2019s not really running in Iowa. This debate is all about one thing: how is Newt going to respond when they come after him?\n\nSo far, Gingrich has been serene and presidential. He has vowed that he\u2019s not going to give us, the jackals of the media, the intra-party carnage we so sorely crave. We\u2019ll see. The last few days, Gingrich has been taking direct hits from Ron Paul, Rick Perry and Mitt Romney. These have mostly come in the form of TV ads, which is a first in this campaign\u2013and it\u2019s not clear whether a public, inured to making real-time judgments about the candidates in the crucible of these wildly entertaining debates, will respond to political advertising.\n\nTo my eye, all these ads are effective. But the two best are Ron Paul\u2019s dismantling of Gingrich on corruption and insiderism, and Rick Perry\u2019s dismantling of both Gingrich and Romney on health insurance. Speaking of Perry, he may be about to experience a slight second coming. He has the money for ads and is about to launch an intense 72-stop, cross-Iowa campaign swing. He also is looking at the very real possibility that Romney and Gingrich will destroy each other in the next few weeks. Of course, as always with Perry, there are daily reminders of his extreme lunkheadedness\u2013today\u2019s example was getting the number of Supreme Court justices wrong in an editorial interview with the Des Moines Register.\n\nThis coming week may be the most intense of the campaign. Christmas looms thereafter, and the voters may be too busy assembling their families and living their lives to pay much heed to the candidates. There will be another debate on Thursday in Iowa. But the event I\u2019m most looking forward to is the \u201cLincoln-Douglas\u201d style debate between Gingrich and Huntsman on Monday in New Hampshire. At the very least, this will be two smart guys going mano-a-mano; and it may be one of Huntsman\u2019s last chances to break through the clutter and make an impact on the race.\n\nTwo other developments of note:\n\nJohn Sununu the Elder, never a very pleasant person, has emerged as Romney\u2019s lead attack dog against Gingrich. He probably isn\u2019t as effective as the former members of Congress, like Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who are expressing concerns about Newt\u2019s, ah, stability.\n\nAnd Gingrich may have fed those concerns by jumping the shark on Israel, calling the Palestinians an \u201cinvented\u201d people and questioning the need for a Palestinian state. This is beyond ridiculous, of course. Whether you call them \u201cPalestinians\u201d or \u201cArabs\u201d or \u201cformer citizens of the Ottoman empire,\u201d the Palestinians were there when the United Nations decided to create the state of Israel. Their desire for a state of their own is no less legitimate than those of the Jordanians, Syrians, Lebanese and Saudis\u2026and the Israelis, all \u201cinvented\u201d out of the remains of the Ottoman empire. Gingrich is right that the Palestinians still don\u2019t recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist\u2013an absolute basic requirement, if peace is to be achieved\u2013but he is ridiculous to deny the Palestinians\u2019 right to exist."

      "source": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Before this season, the last time outfielder Ben Revere was not a full-time starter in the majors was 2010, when the Minnesota Twins called him up for his big league debut. Over the next five years, he established himself as a reliable leadoff hitter with top-end speed and contact ability. The combination prompted the Nationals to acquire him from the Blue Jays for Drew Storen over the offseason to replace Denard Span as their leadoff man and center fielder.\n\nThis season, however, has been a disaster. It began when Revere strained his right oblique on his first swing of the season. He returned a month later, three days after his 28th birthday, and struggled, unable to find his rhythm at the plate. His troubles initially resulted in a platoon role with Michael A. Taylor. Now, Revere, a .295 career hitter before this season, is batting .213 and his role might shrink again.\n\nOn Thursday, the Nationals started top prospect Trea Turner over Revere center field for the first time. Turner, 23, had never played center field at the professional level until a month ago, but the converted shortstop has transitioned without a hitch. Turner went 2-for-4 with a walk, RBI, run, and stolen base, while handling AT&T Park\u2019s expansive outfield without a problem in the Nationals\u2019 4-2 win over the Giants.\n\n\u201cIt sucks, but I understand,\u201d Revere said before the game. \u201cI\u2019m in a rut and Trea is playing well. They\u2019re trying to win a championship and I\u2019ll do whatever they want me to.\u201d\n\nNationals Manager Dusty Baker said Turner, a right-handed hitter, got the start against Giants right-hander Johnny Cueto instead of the left-handed hitting Revere because Cueto has been better against left-handed batters over his career, though that isn\u2019t the case this season.\n\nRevere said he hadn\u2019t spoken to Baker about his role, but the manager insisted the decision wasn\u2019t permanent. He pointed out that Revere hit the ball hard a few times in Cleveland earlier this week, where he started two games in left field, and was the victim of some bad luck.\n\n\u201cI just keep talking to him,\u201d Baker said. \u201cYou get tired of hearing, \u2018You hit it hard\u2019 or \u2018Hang in there.\u2019 You get tired of hearing all those things. Sometimes you just run out of things to say and you just hope and pray that they get some breaks. Ben\u2019s hit the ball hard, man, and he got nothing for it.\u201d\n\nTurner has made a case to be in the lineup every day. The Nationals have gotten the worst production out of their leadoff hitters in the majors this season. They\u2019re last in batting average (.220), last in on-base percentage (.265), 29th in on-base-plus-slugging percentage (.604), and tied for last in runs created (59 RC+).\n\nRevere is batting .220 with a .578 OPS in 54 games as the leadoff hitter. He\u2019s hit second twice and ninth twice. In nine starts as the leadoff man, Turner is hitting .317 with an .812 OPS.\n\nRevere said he spoke with Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis in Cleveland earlier this week about the oblique ailment and its after-effects. Kipnis had the same injury in 2014, when he batted a career-worst .240 in 129 games. The miserable season was sandwiched by all-star appearances in 2013 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make excuses, but if I didn\u2019t have that injury, it\u2019d be a whole different story,\u201d Revere said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst injuries for a hitter.\u201d\n\nRevere said his swing is still not the same, nearly three months after returning. He hopes he can figure it out this season before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating because it\u2019s the first year I\u2019m struggling like this,\u201d Revere said. \u201cThere are times when I think I\u2019m feeling good and I hit the ball hard but I fall flat on my face. It\u2019s like the harder you fight, the more you sink.\u201d"

The annual Israeli memorial day for the 6 million Jews killed during the Holocaust of the World War II begins at sundown Sunday.AP\n\nJERUSALEM \u2013 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened the country's annual memorial day for the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust by issuing a stern warning Sunday to the world to learn the lessons of the past and prevent another Holocaust.\n\nAt the opening ceremony at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, Netanyahu linked the Nazi genocide to Iran's suspected drive to acquire nuclear bombs and its leaders' repeated references to the destruction of Israel and its denial of the Holocaust. Netanyahu said that just like before World War II, there were those in the world today who refused to face uncomfortable truths.\n\n\"In this place I have said many times that we must identify an existential threat in time and act against it in time and tonight I ask 'why in the years before the Holocaust did most of the world's leaders not see the danger ahead of time?' In hindsight, all the signs were there,\" he said.\n\n\"Has the world learned a lesson from the mistakes of the past? Today we are again faced with clear facts and before a real danger. Iran calls for our destruction, it develops nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe stated links between the Holocaust and Iran showed how more than six decades later, the mass murder of Jews during World War II is still a central part of Israel's psyche. The nation was created just three years after the end of the war, and hundreds of thousands of dazed survivors made their way to Israel.\n\nSix million Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators in the Holocaust, wiping out a third of world Jewry. Today, fewer than 200,000 elderly survivors remain in Israel.\n\nThe annual memorial day is one of the most solemn on Israel's calendar. Restaurants, cafes and places of entertainment are shut down, and radio and TV programming are dedicated almost exclusively to documentaries about the Holocaust, interviews with survivors and somber music.\n\nOn Monday morning, Israel will come to a standstill as sirens wail for two minutes. Pedestrians typically stop in their tracks, and cars and buses halt on the streets while drivers and passengers stand with their heads bowed.\n\nFurther ceremonies include the public reading of names of Holocaust victims at sites around the country, including Israel's parliament. Schoolchildren dress in white and stop their studies to hold memorial ceremonies.\n\nSunday night's main ceremony at Yad Vashem included six survivors who lit six symbolic torches to commemorate the 6 million dead. A video segment on each one's personal story was presented.\n\nThe Israeli flag flew at half-staff and a military honor guard stood at one side of the podium as poems and psalms were read and the Jewish prayer for the dead was recited.\n\nHours before the opening ceremony, an annual report by Tel Aviv University on worldwide anti-Semitism said violent attacks against Jews worldwide dropped in 2013, but anti-Semitism was becoming more widespread in Europe amid a rise in popularity of extremist parties\n\nMoshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, an umbrella group representing Jewish communities across Europe, expressed concern over the increasing popularity of far-right parties, especially in France, Hungary and Greece, where they are expected to make big gains in European Parliament elections next month.\n\nHe also mentioned the situation in Ukraine, where Jews are caught in the middle of the conflict between nationalists and Russian separatists, with both sides using anti-Jewish rhetoric while accusing each other of harboring anti-Semitic supporters.\n\nIn his comments, Israeli President Shimon Peres spoke of his own family's destruction in the Holocaust and said Israel was the deterrence against another one happening.\n\n\"We must not ignore any occurrence of anti-Semitism, any desecration of a synagogue, any tombstone smashed in a cemetery in which our families are buried. We must not ignore the rise of extreme right-wing parties with neo-Nazi tendencies who are a danger to each of us and a threat to every nation,\" he said.\n\n\"A strong Israel is our response to the horrors of anti-Semitism but it does not excuse the rest of the world from its responsibility to prevent this disease from returning to their own homes.\""

Andrew Cuomo.\n\nProsecutors say they expect to present a month-long case against Silver.\n\nAmong the new allegations in the superseding indictment handed up last week is that he put $340,000 from his account under a family member\u2019s name in 2011 to dodge disclosure laws that would have forced him to reveal the shady investments.\n\nSilver also allegedly transferred $642,000 into investment vehicles that more than doubled in value since 2006 to at least $1.4 million. The revised indictment also claims Silver did not pay a fee to the adviser for access to the high-yield private instruments and never disclosed to the adviser the source of the funds.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Carrie Cohen said the investigation is ongoing and did not rule out revising the indictment again with new charges.\n\nManhattan US Attorney Preet BhararaPhoto: David McGlynn\n\n\u201cI do not rule that we discover something as we continue our investigation,\u201d she said.\n\nCaproni set Nov. 2 as the trial start date.\n\nMolo had pushed for a later date because he\u2019s handling a health-care fraud case in Chicago federal court that could potentially overlap with Silver\u2019s trial, but Caproni refused to begin any later than Nov. 2.\n\nSilver\u2019s Assembly seat and others in Albany are not up for re-election until 2016, so the trial is expected to have little statewide political impact.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Silver told The Post when asked about the trial date. \u201cWe will be vindicated whenever.\u201d\n\nHe later told a crowd of reporters gathered outside the courthouse that he\u2019s \u201cglad\u201d a trial date has been set, adding, \u201cI am confident that at the end of this process I will be totally vindicated.\u201d\n\nSilver, once acknowledged as the second-most powerful Democrat in the state, was forced to step down as speaker following his arrest in January. He remains a member of the Assembly.\n\nHis stunning arrest capped a secret grand jury probe that began in June 2013, and marked the latest in a string of public corruption cases spearheaded by crusading Bharara.\n\nSilver, 71, faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted."

      "source": "Life as a public corporation is far different from that of a private company. A successful IPO opens the door to some exciting business opportunities. However, once your company is public, financial reporting takes on a heightened level of importance and you will face a new level of scrutiny.\n\nSo if an IPO is your goal, it\u2019s critical to build an infrastructure that is ready for the rigors of the public markets. Develop a robust infrastructure comprised of people, processes and systems that will enable the production of timely, accurate financial information for purposes of forecasting, financial reporting and compliance with new public company regulations.\n\nHere are five important steps in that preparation process.\n\n1. Financial reporting: Often, newly public companies find it a challenge to produce financial statements and disclosures, along with completing the necessary executive-level reviews, under the new regulatory reporting timelines. Start early to comply with local securities laws, and consider potential IPO accounting and reporting issues. Also, practice preparing your quarterly and/or annual financial statements on an SEC-ready timeline as if you were already public for at least 2 quarters prior to the IPO.\n\n2. IT systems: Information systems need to be aligned both with the company\u2019s business objectives and critical reporting requirements. Management should have the informational tools that allow for timely reporting, informed decision-making and the ability to quickly answer analysts\u2019 questions.\n\n3. Internal controls: Develop written financial accounting and SEC reporting policies and procedures to support your public company internal control environment. At least 12 months prior to the IPO, begin executing a plan to complete management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n4. Forecasting: During quarterly and annual conference calls, shareholders and analysts will want to know your earnings guidance. So start now to improve your budgeting and forecasting capabilities and enhance management and financial reporting capabilities.\n\n5. Housekeeping: There\u2019s no time like the present to start getting your house in order. Also consider whether your existing corporate, capital, and management structures are appropriate for a public company.\n\nEY\u2019s experience shows that a strong infrastructure can help facilitate regulatory compliance, protect against risk exposure and provide guidance to meet or beat market expectations. Furthermore, such an infrastructure can ensure that business execution continues apace despite the focus on the IPO transaction.\n\nTell me: If you\u2019re planning to go public , what steps are you taking?"

Ai Weiwei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artworks will be in the prison and an adjacent laundry building.\n\nThe Chinese artist and political dissident Ai Weiwei was one of the most famous prisoners in recent history. Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking on one of the most infamous prisons of all time, using Alcatraz as the inspiration and site for a series of new artworks to debut next September.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unusual chapter for Alcatraz, the first time the former penitentiary is opening its extra-strength, tool-proof steel doors for a major contemporary artist, according to the National Park Service. It also promises to be a high-profile project for Mr. Ai, who said by phone from Beijing that he has never visited Alcatraz but is interested in exploring conditions in which individuals are stripped of basic human rights: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea of loss of freedom as a punishment raises philosophical questions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have too many friends today who are still in jail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that people who are fighting for freedom have lost their freedom being incarcerated is more than ironic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Ai himself was detained for 81 days in 2011 on tax evasion charges, following his lengthy investigation into the Chinese government for shoddy construction that contributed to the deaths of thousands of schoolchildren in their classrooms during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Supporters of Mr. Ai said the tax inquiry was a pretext to silence one of the most outspoken critics of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government. The 56-year-old artist remains subject to travel restrictions. (Do not, for example, expect him at the grand opening of the P\u00c3\u00a9rez Art Museum Miami this week, where his retrospective is the big inaugural show.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy passport has been in the hands of police for almost three years now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost my ability to travel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor the Alcatraz project, he is working closely with Cheryl Haines, a San Francisco gallery owner who founded the nonprofit foundation For-Site to help realize site-specific public-art projects in the Bay Area.\n\nBesides noting the art\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of sculpture and sound, Ms. Haines said it was too early to provide specifics on the works. But she did describe some themes that are likely to emerge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really rich site that allows him to address the most basic human rights, like freedom of expression and its importance in building a culture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also hoping to address parallels between forms of imprisonment and governments that use restrictions in communications to control people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Ai said that he is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot thinking about work that will directly connect to my own detention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he was recently for a set of six dioramas shown in a church in Venice. (Those sculptural tableaus recreated painfully cramped scenes from his own detainment, like his being interrogated or showering, all under the watch of two guards.)\n\nThe plan is to install some artworks in the building that served as a maximum-security penitentiary from 1934 to 1963. Other works are intended for an adjacent laundry building, where inmates like Al Capone were once put to work.\n\nMs. Haines said she has long been interested in the multilayered history of Alcatraz \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as federal prison, a military prison before that, and later as a site of American Indian protests. She said she first mentioned the place to Mr. Ai during a visit two years ago to his studio on the outskirts of Beijing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was talking about how interested he was in reaching a broad audience, beyond the art world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said by telephone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was just four months after his release from incarceration, and this thought popped into my mind: \u00e2\u0080\u0098What if I brought you a prison?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter the artist expressed interest, Ms. Haines worked to gain support from the National Park Service, which oversees the island, and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, which provides funding and programming for it.\n\nFrank Dean, a National Park Service superintendent for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, said there was serious interest in Mr. Ai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work from the start but also practical issues his group had to review before issuing approval. The island, which measures only 22 acres, receives 1.5 million visitors annually \u00e2\u0080\u0094 up to 5,000 daily during peak season."

The ban has been increased from two years to four years, which will also act as a deterrent.\u201d\n\nLondon Marathon organisers, meanwhile, are delighted after signing up a field that they believe could be its strongest ever. The race not only pits Kipsang and Kimetto \u2013 the two fastest marathoners of all time \u2013 but also includes six other men who have run under 2hr 5min.

If the weather is OK and the guys are really ready to for a fast time it\u2019s possible on that course.\u201d\n\nIntriguingly, Kipsang said he would like the leading group to go through halfway in 61:35min \u2013 10 seconds quicker than Kimetto\u2019s time after 13 miles in Berlin. But Kipsang insists that with such a strong field he faces multiple threats.\n\n\u201cEliud Kipchogeis very strong as is Emmanuel Mutai,\u201d he said. \u201cI think even Bekele could be a good challenge and we saw last year what Stanley Biwott did. These are the guys that are really going to be the threat.\u201d"

      "source": "President Obama and Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping meet at the White House in Washington on February 14.\n\nEditor's note: Kenneth Lieberthal is director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution. He is the author, with Wang Jisi, of \"Addressing US-China Strategic Distrust.\"\n\n(CNN) -- The United States and China have the most important bilateral relationship in the world. Whether they can develop a constructive, cooperative relationship or whether they become each others' greatest nightmare has enormous consequences for each country and for the capacity of the international system to manage regional and global issues.\n\nBoth leaderships recognize what is at stake, which explains why, despite many disagreements, Washington and Beijing constantly stress the importance of building ties. The two governments conduct more than 60 formal dialogues a year and engage each other daily, to a far greater extent than most people realize.\n\nDespite these efforts, each country has an underlying and growing distrust of the other's long-term intentions. Such distrust is corrosive, casting even well-intentioned actions and initiatives in a negative light.\n\nWhen President Nixon opened the door to Beijing 40 years ago, nobody imagined that U.S.-China relations would develop to this point. But extensive governmental contacts between the nations, economic interdependence and huge flows of students and tourists back and forth have failed to stem the growth of underlying mutual distrust. That distrust could well create a self-fulfilling prophecy of eventual confrontation.\n\nA key problem is that neither government is confident that it understands how the other sees the future of their relationship. Although each side senses distrust in the other, the real reasons for that attitude are unclear. So, how do they separate propaganda efforts designed to manipulate from sincere concerns?\n\nBecause this is such a tough and consequential problem, I teamed up with one of China's leading America specialists to write a report that lays out the underlying worries that each side has about the other and, especially, why they have these deep concerns. Our report was published simultaneously last week in English and Chinese.\n\nMy colleague wrote, in unvarnished fashion, about the analysis that leads many policymakers in China to believe the ultimate goal of the United States is to constrain or disrupt China's rise and to undermine its political system. I wrote about U.S. hopes for a normal major power relationship with China over the long run and the reasons why many American policymakers are increasingly concerned that this may prove impossible.\n\nThe reasons are complicated. In part, they include the inevitable tensions that arise when a global balance of power is changing. My colleague and I expect that America will retain its leading role for many years to come, but the gap between U.S. and Chinese power and position is narrowing. Because of that, many in China fear the United States might resort to anti-Chinese measures to maintain its lead. American officials worry not so much that China will rise, but that Beijing will believe it can only do so at direct cost to the United States.\n\nOur enormously different political systems exacerbate this distrust. Neither side understands very well the political and institutional constraints in the other's system, and both are inclined to assume the other is more strategic, centralized and internally disciplined than it is. Neither is certain that it knows when the other is being honest about its domestic political constraints, and both tend to take random events as reflections of strategic intent.\n\nBeijing views America's pro-democracy foreign policy as aimed, in part, at changing China's system, while Washington inherently distrusts the motives and actions of authoritarian governments. And unsurprisingly, both sides have partially institutionalized distrust in their militaries, intelligence agencies, and offices focused on cybersecurity.\n\nDistrust about long-term intentions is thus grounded in complicated narratives in both countries. Neither side wants an adversarial relationship, but both worry that it may become unavoidable. And extensive efforts to build mutual trust to date are not working.\n\nNew measures are necessary. Both governments must discuss, in depth, topics they have been avoiding. What overall military postures in Asia will both permit China to meet its vital security needs and enable America to defend its allies and interests? What kinds of mutual restraint can help bring about this outcome?\n\nHow does each side view potential developments on the Korean Peninsula over the coming decade, and how would both plan to react to each scenario?\n\nAmerica conducts surveillance activities just outside China's territorial waters that Beijing views as hostile and degrading. Could China provide some type of increased military transparency that could change this? Could the military component of the Taiwan issue be reduced?\n\nUnderstanding views of the long term, clarifying thinking on key military issues and devising concrete efforts to build mutual confidence are the initiatives that could alter the perceptions in Washington and Beijing that enhance distrust. The future can be shaped by intelligent actions, but those must be based on clear recognition of the reasons why each side fears the future intentions of the other.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @CNN Opinion.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kenneth Lieberthal."

      "source": "The games of Week 13 mark the end of the regular season for many fantasy leagues.\n\nBut unquestionably, the most scrutinized and debated play of the week was Denver quarterback Jay Cutler's first start against Seattle on Sunday night. Cutler was uneven, as you'd expect, but did make several big throws when needed. Rookie Brandon Marshall, who I'd touted for some reason on a Saturday radio appearance, bailed both Cutler and me out by breaking several tackles en route to a 71-yard touchdown run. Cutler finished with two touchdown passes, 143 passing yards and committed three turnovers. Fantasy owners who plugged Cutler in this week certainly appreciated the magical run from Marshall after the strike on the 12-yard out against a zone defense and have to be encouraged by the energy that his insertion seemed to inspire.\n\nOther fantasy owners weren't so lucky, as Drew Brees, Tony Romo and Matt Hasselbeck failed to deliver amid high expectations.\n\nLet's review the performances of Week 13.\n\nThe action of Week 13 started back on Thursday with a huge win by the Bengals against the Ravens. The star of the day was T.J. Houshmandzadeh, who hauled in 10 passes for 106 yards and scored on a 40-yard flea-flicker from Carson Palmer. The Ravens are still wondering precisely how Houshmandzadeh got so wide open, and Palmer thanked the fans for alerting him to the fact that Houshmandzadeh had blown past coverage. Palmer completed 21-of-32 passes against the stellar Baltimore defense for 234 yards and the touchdown pass to Houshmandzadeh.\n\nChad Johnson finished the game with eight receptions for 91 yards. After a slow start to the season, Johnson now has four straight games with at least 91 yards receiving (166 yards per game).\n\nVeteran receiver Derrick Mason made the most of his opportunities on Thursday, hauling in seven passes for 90 yards and a touchdown off the arm of Steve McNair (26-of-43 for 227 yards and one touchdown). Mason has averaged 5.75 receptions per game over the past month.\n\nReggie Bush finally made his mark on the pro game with his four-touchdown performance against the 49ers. Bush showed tremendous heart and competitiveness in his runs, carrying would-be tacklers toward the goal-line. Bush caught nine passes for 131 yards and added 37 rushing yards in the win. Bush has now caught 73 passes this season.\n\nDeuce McAllister shouldered the heavy load with 26 carries for 136 yards against San Francisco. It was McAllister's second 100-yard game of the year. Unfortunately for fantasy owners, Bush got the call down low this week.\n\nThe Chicago defense came up huge on a day when the offense fizzled against Minnesota. The Bears received two touchdowns from the defense and special teams (a Ricky Manning, Jr. interception and Devin Hester punt return) and generated three sacks and five turnovers in the NFC North-clinching game.\n\nThe Bears did have one bright spot on offense. Backup running back Cedric Benson spelled starter Thomas Jones with nine carries for 60 yards, including a 24-yard touchdown scamper for the team's only offensive touchdown of the day.\n\nFor all of the turnovers committed by the Vikings, they did produce a tremendous running game. Workhorse Chester Taylor carried the ball 17 times for 99 yards (5.8 yards per carry) before leaving with a rib injury. Second-year back Ciatrick Fason replaced Taylor in the backfield and piled up 75 yards on 11 carries including a four-yard touchdown run late in the game. Keep an eye on Taylor's development this week. Fason would make for a solid sleeper pick next week against Detroit if Taylor is unavailable.\n\nEdgerrin James posted his first 100-yard game of the season in the blowout win over St. Louis. James carried the ball 26 times for 115 yards after touching the ball just six times last week against the Vikings. In a disappointment-filled season, James does have one milestone in his reach. James needs to average just 47.5 yards per game over the final month to reach 1,000 yards for the season.\n\nFor all of his strong running yesterday, James was the odd man out in the red zone. Marcel Shipp carried the ball seven times for 21 yards and scored three times. Shipp had carried the ball only three times for six yards coming into Sunday's game.\n\nSt. Louis running back Steven Jackson continued his phenomenal run as the workhorse against the Cardinals. He rushed for 96 yards and added nine receptions for 69 yards. Jackson has accrued 87 or more yards of total offense in 10 of 12 games this season.\n\nTorry Holt ended his scoring drought with a big game against the Cardinals. Holt had been scoreless in five consecutive games ahead of his seven-reception, 115-yard performance. Holt also reached the century mark receiving for the first time since Week 6.\n\nHolt's longtime partner in the receiving corps, Isaac Bruce, also posted his best game in weeks. Bruce caught five passes for 75 yards and scored for the first time since Week 4.\n\nMarc Bulger contributed his best game for fantasy owners since Week 8 with 314 yards and two touchdowns against the Cardinals. His late touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 35 seconds remaining saved what had otherwise been a disappointing game for the Rams. Bulger was also sacked four times and three a season-high three interceptions in this game. After throwing one interception in his first eight games this season, Bulger has now thrown interceptions in four consecutive outings.\n\nLarry Fitzgerald didn't match his ridiculous yardage total of Week 12, but he found the end zone for the first time since Week 5. Fitzgerald caught five passes for 46 yards in the win.\n\nThe Redskins raced out to a 14-point advantage over the Falcons on the strength of Ladell Betts' legs and a great adjustment on a deep route by Santana Moss.\n\nBetts and the Redskins' power running game controlled the line of scrimmage, generating 155 rushing yards on 28 attempts. It was Betts' second consecutive 100-yard game and third of the season. Since taking over for the injured Clinton Portis, Betts has topped 80 rushing yards in three of his four starts. His touchdown run was his first since Week 3.\n\nSantana Moss has been slowed by a hamstring injury for weeks, but he gutted it out on Sunday to offer his first touchdown since Week 4. Moss caught seven passes for 123 yards, nearly matching his receiving total in the five games in which he's appeared since that monster Week 4 outing. He made a great read on an under-thrown ball from Jason Campbell for the 42-yard touchdown reception.\n\nMichael Vick silenced his critics, if only for a day, with a tremendous performance in a must-win game against the Redskins. Down 14-0, Vick led the Falcons to 24 straight points for the win. He tossed touchdown passes to Alge Crumpler (his seventh) and Michael Jenkins (his sixth) while completing only 8-of-16 pass attempts for 122 yards. As always, Vick contributed to the bottom line of fantasy owners with 59 rushing yards.\n\nRookie Jerious Norwood exploded onto the scene with his 69-yard touchdown run against the Redskins. Norwood carried the ball nine times for 109 yards. Norwood topped 50 rushing yards for the second straight game and notched his second 100-yard game of the season.\n\nDetroit receiver Mike Furrey remains one of the game's top surprises and posted another strong effort against the Patriots. The former safety caught nine passes for 123 yards and scored his fourth touchdown of the season. Furrey has topped 60 receiving yards in five of his last six games and now has 65 receptions and 773 receiving yards on the season.\n\nPatriots wideout Reche Caldwell is finally getting to show his talent after years of injury problems. Caldwell caught eight passes for 112 yards in the comeback win over Detroit and has recorded at least 70 receiving yards in four of his last six games.\n\nLions running back Kevin Jones contributed a tremendous game against the Patriots, but it could have been so much more. Jones rushed for 56 yards and added another 86 yards on five receptions (142 total yards) and lost a crucial fumble inside the Patriots' five-yard line. Still, Jones has accrued 80 or more total yards in eight of the 11 games in which he's appeared this season.\n\nCorey Dillon didn't pile up yardage, but he found the end zone three times in the comeback win. Dillon carried the ball nine times for 25 yards as the primary ball carrier for New England after Laurence Maroney left because of an injury. Dillon has scored 10 touchdowns this season on 141 carries.\n\nTitans rookie quarterback Vince Young has now claimed back-to-back victories over the Manning brothers with a dramatic 20-17 win over the Colts. Young completed 15-of-25 attempts for 163 yards with two touchdown passes and two interceptions. He also added nine carries for 78 yards. Young completed passes to 10 different receivers on the day.\n\nYoung connected with Drew Bennett and Brandon Jones for his touchdown strikes. Jones has now caught touchdown passes in consecutive weeks.\n\nTravis Henry piled up 93 yards on 20 carries to aid the winning cause. Henry has now accrued 90 or more rushing yards in three of his last four starts.\n\nFantasy owners breathed a sigh of relief when Marvin Harrison streaked down the center of the field for an early 68-yard touchdown reception. It snapped a three-game scoreless streak during which Harrison had accrued a total of nine receptions for 123 yards. Harrison finished Sunday's heartbreaking loss with seven receptions for 172 yards and his sixth touchdown of the season. The touchdown was his 100th career score from Peyton Manning.\n\nFor his part, Manning completed 75 percent of his throws for 351 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in the defeat. It was hardly his best effort, but the heavy yardage total certainly helped more than a few fantasy owners. Manning has thrown at least one touchdown pass in all 12 games played this season while throwing for an average of 276 yards.\n\nI always admit an error, and I got the Kansas City-Cleveland game wrong. Cleveland came with a much stronger effort than I expected and Trent Green returned to fantasy prominence in a big way. After two very quiet weeks since returning from injury, Green exploded against the Browns on Sunday. Green completed 24-of-32 passes for 297 yards with four touchdowns against one interception. He still has two very difficult matchups on tap in Weeks 14 and 15 (Baltimore and San Diego), but it's good to have him back in the argument.\n\nGreen reconnected with Eddie Kennison (seven receptions for 117 yards and a touchdown) and Tony Gonzalez (nine receptions for 105 yards and two touchdowns). Kennison had tallied only eight receptions for 131 yards in his previous four contests. Gonzalez reached the 100-yard mark for the third time this season and has accrued 60 or more receiving yards in five of his last six games played.\n\nLarry Johnson saw his nine-game scoring streak fall to the wayside, but he reached the 100-yard mark for the eighth time this season and sixth time in seven games. If Johnson can match his season average of 109.3 rushing yards per game in the final four weeks, he'll finish the year with 1,749 rushing yards.\n\nBackup tight end Steve Heiden was the recipient of two fourth-quarter touchdown passes off the arm of Cleveland backup Derek Anderson. Heiden caught five passes for 26 yards as a safety valve for Anderson. He'll be interesting to watch in the final weeks of the season.\n\nAnderson performed brilliantly in relief of injured starter Charlie Frye to engineer the victory over Kansas City. He completed 12-of-21 attempts for 171 yards wit two touchdowns and one interception. Anderson also rushed twice for 44 yards. He'll assume the reins this week against Pittsburgh on Thursday night.\n\nFrye had completed 11-of-13 passes for 122 yards and one touchdown before departing with a broken wrist. Frye hooked up with Braylon Edwards for a touchdown before departing (three receptions for 36 yards).\n\nReuben Droughns was the subject of much rumor, conjecture and speculation in Cleveland after carrying the ball twice in the blowout loss to Cincinnati in Week 12. Droughns returned to the field and assumed control of the backfield, carrying the ball 14 times for 70 yards and a score, his fourth of the season. It appears that he'll be back in the top spot going forward. For what it's worth, backup Jason Wright accrued 95 yards of total offense (25 rushing and 70 receiving).\n\nChad Pennington took advantage of a porous Green Bay pass defense to complete 25-of-35 attempts for 263 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions in the blowout win. Pennington has thrown three touchdown passes in his last two games and finishes with three favorable matchups in his final four games.\n\nJerricho Cotchery narrowly missed his second consecutive 100-yard receiving game, hauling in nine receptions for 99 yards and a score against the Packers.\n\nTight end Chris Baker matched a season-high with four receptions and established a new season-high with 50 receiving yards. Baker also scored for the first time since Week 3.\n\nSecond-year Jets back Cedric Houson made his pitch to claim the starting role with 105 rushing yards on 22 attempts with two short touchdown plunges against Green Bay. Houston has scored three touchdowns in the past two weeks and will continue in the vulture role at a minimum, with Leon Washington working into the mix (seven carries for 40 yards and a touchdown).\n\nDonald Driver caught only three passes in this game, but did a great job to hang onto a bullet from Brett Favre for a short touchdown. Driver finished with 41 receiving yards.\n\nAhman Green continued his strong comeback campaign with another big day on the ground. Green rushed for 102 yards and added four receptions for 38 yards against the Jets. He's topped 100 rushing yards on five occasions and has contributed at least 80 total yards in eight of 10 games in which he's played.\n\nLaDainian Tomlinson made another step toward history with two rushing touchdowns and 178 rushing yards against the Bills. Tomlinson has rushed for 100 yards in six consecutive games and has accounted for multiple scores in eight consecutive games.\n\nAntonio Gates scored for the second consecutive week, this time by the conventional quarterback to tight end toss. Gates caught seven passes for 90 yards in this game, his highest yardage total of the season. Fantasy owners are thankful to see Gates back in the mix as the fantasy playoffs begin.\n\nJ.P. Losman couldn't connect with Lee Evans, but he did throw for 184 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to San Diego. Peerless Price and Robert Royal were the recipients of his touchdown strikes.\n\nWillis McGahee was limited to 26 yards on the ground and was no doubt giving his fantasy owners fits, but his two-yard plunge into the end zone made everything right. McGahee has now scored three touchdowns in the last two weeks.\n\nSan Francisco receiver Antonio Bryant was the lone bright spot for the offense on Sunday. He caught four passes for 79 yards and scored his third touchdown of the season. Bryant had recorded two receptions in four consecutive games with fewer than 60 receiving yards in each prior to Sunday's strong effort.\n\nMaurice Jones-Drew continued his bid toward claiming Offensive Rookie of the Year honors with another big effort against the Jaguars. Jones-Drew carried the ball five times for 46 yards, including a 32-yard touchdown run. Jones-Drew has now scored in four consecutive games and has accrued 817 total yards and nine touchdowns this season (eight different games).\n\nJaguars quarterback David Garrard posted his third strong start in his last five by picking apart a surging Miami defense. Garrard completed 16-of-22 passes for 229 yards and two scores. He has thrown multiple touchdown passes in three of his last five starts.\n\nMatt Jones has now scored in back-to-back games for Jacksonville, and assumed the receiving lead with six receptions for 128 yards against Miami. Jones leads the Jaguars with 451 receiving yards in spite of missing three games entirely and much of two others with a variety of injuries. Jones makes for a strong play in Week 14 against smaller Indianapolis cornerbacks.\n\nDolphins receiver Marty Booker continued to be Joey Harrington's top receiver in the red zone, catching five balls for 61 yards and a touchdown. Booker has scored in four of his last six games and has averaged six receptions in his last three outings.\n\nBooker found the end zone, but Chris Chambers finally gave loyal fantasy owners something to cheer about. Chambers hadn't topped 70 receiving yards in any of his first 11 games this season, but he tallied eight catches for 121 yards on Sunday.\n\nThe Oakland defense appeared as one of the sleeper picks for this week against Houston, and delivered in a 23-14 loss. Oakland's defense contributed a touchdown, five sacks and generated two turnovers.\n\nWali Lundy rushed for 33 yards and a touchdown, but the story of the day for the Texans offense was the re-emergence of Ron Dayne. Dayne carried the ball 18 times for 95 yards (5.3 yards per carry average) to jump into the backfield by committee situation in Houston.\n\nJustin Fargas scored the lone Oakland offensive touchdown (49 yards rushing), but ReShard Lee was the more productive back. Lee carried the ball six times for 42 yards and added five receptions for 57 yards.\n\nGiants quarterback Eli Manning bounced back in a big way against the Cowboys on Sunday after a week of tremendous criticism. Manning completed 67 percent of his pass attempts for 270 yards and two touchdowns without a turnover. Manning's last two multi-touchdown efforts came against Dallas.\n\nMarion Barber III made another strong case to Bill Parcells that he should assume the role of primary ball carrier in the Dallas backfield, and no one should argue at this point. Barber plunged into the end zone twice and contributed 76 rushing yards on 12 carries. He is averaging a robust 5.2 yards per carry this season and has piled up 13 total touchdowns.\n\nDallas receiver Terrell Owens had several drops once again, but still hauled in eight balls for 84 yards as his connection with Tony Romo continues to grow.\n\nJeremy Shockey caught six balls for 65 yards and a touchdown in Week 13. Shockey ended his three-game scoring drought with his early touchdown reception. He's alternated great and mediocre games for the past six weeks.\n\nPlaxico Burress rallied from a week of criticism to catch four passes for 43 yards and the late tying touchdown on a bullet from Eli Manning. He was also flagged for a 15-yard penalty for a late block as the whistle blowed, showing the team that he heard the messages of the past week loud and clear. Burress has scored in five of the last six games in which he's appeared.\n\nAnd how about the big pick-up of this week? Martin Gramatica paid huge dividends in his first game as the Cowboys kicker, connecting on 3-of-4 field goals with two PATs and the game-winner. Jason Witten shortened Gramatica's usual celebration by hugging him with the hope of preventing an injury. Gramatica is a top waiver wire player this week.\n\nBen Roethlisberger took advantage of a matchup against the struggling Tampa Bay secondary. He completed only 12-of-25 attempts, but completed touchdown passes to tight ends Jerame Tuman and Heath Miller. Roethlisberger threw only one interception on the day. Nate Washington led all Pittsburgh receivers with three receptions for 78 yards.\n\nTatum Bell of the Broncos returned to the lineup to reclaim the starting tailback role from a struggling Mike Bell. He reported no pain in his toes and carried the ball 23 times for 133 yards in his first game back after missing two straight games and three of the previous four Broncos contests. For what it's worth, only 21 of his 133 yards came in the second half.\n\nSeattle kicker Josh Brown missed his first two field goal attempts in the Sunday night matchup against Denver, but he righted the ship and made them when they counted. Brown kicked a 50-yard field goal with five seconds left for his fourth game-winning field goal of the year. He converted three second-half field goals against the Broncos.\n\nShaun Alexander was bottled up early, but better offensive line play and a couple of big runs in the second half allowed him to finish with 90 yards and a score.\n\nDarrell Jackson caught two big passes on the drive that ended with Alexander's touchdown. He finished with six catches for 91 yards to lead all receivers on Sunday night.\n\nThe struggles of Rex Grossman continue with another three-interception game. Grossman completed just 6-of-19 attempts for a meager 34 yards. The matchup looked enticing against a struggling Minnesota pass defense, but Grossman was unable to find any rhythm all day. As such, Bernard Berrian (21 yards) and Muhsin Muhammad (five yards) offered no help to fantasy owners. The schedule looks bright for Grossman and the Bears to close the season, but fantasy owners certainly can't trust his right arm with the playoffs on tap. Grossman has turned the ball over 18 times since Week 6.\n\nMinnesota quarterback Brad Johnson found himself on the bench after tossing four interceptions and completing just 11-of-26 pass attempts for 73 yards. Tarvaris Jackson or Brooks Bollinger may assume the reins in Minnesota after relieving Johnson this week.\n\nStarting tailback Thomas Jones of the Bears struggled to 32 yards on 12 carries against the stout Minnesota run defense. This lackluster performance ended a streak of three games for Jones with at least 99 rushing yards.\n\nThe Bengals defense did a tremendous job in shutting down a Ravens offense that had scored 24 or more points in the games since Brian Billick took over play-calling. Jamal Lewis posted a solid yardage total (61 rushing and 26 receiving), but his scoring streak ended at two games. Todd Heap caught four passes for 27 yards. It marked the fourth time in five games that the big tight end was held without a score after his torrid start to the season.\n\nChris Henry of the Bengals had been plugged in to many lineups as a third receiver. He failed to record a reception this week.\n\nThe Cardinals piled up points this week, but the Rams did a great job in shutting down Anquan Boldin. The star receiver was limited to two receptions for 32 yards in the win.\n\nWashington receiving star Chris Cooley, who had scored in five of his previous six games, was shut down by the Falcons on Sunday. Cooley caught two passes for 12 yards, his lowest receiving total since Week 1.\n\nDetroit quarterback Jon Kitna threw for 314 yards and a touchdown on 22-of-38 passing, but also took five sacks and turned the ball over four times against the Patriots. It marked his 10th consecutive game with at least one interception this season. Does Josh McCown's appearance as a receiver (two receptions for 15 yards) mean that the end is near for Kitna in Detroit?\n\nFurrey was the star on Sunday, as New England worked to shut down Roy Williams. Williams contributed three receptions for 50 yards in a quiet performance.\n\nTom Brady threw for 305 yards, but failed to find the end zone against Detroit. After a strong start to the season, Brady has thrown one or zero touchdowns in four of his last five games.\n\nLeading receiver Ben Watson of the Patriots was limited to three receptions for 41 yards, but lost a fumble. Watson has accrued 40 or more receiving yards in six of his last seven games.\n\nReggie Wayne caught three passes against Tennessee to reach the 1,000-yard mark for the third consecutive season. However, Wayne was scoreless for only the second time in his last eight games and accrued only 57 receiving yards.\n\nFantasy owners counted on a huge follow-up effort from Joseph Addai after his four-touchdown performance in Week 12. They were left wanting on Sunday, as Addai tallied only 56 rushing yards on 16 attempts and watched Dominic Rhodes score the lone rushing touchdown of the year (12 carries for 39 yards).\n\nBen Utecht was one of the top sleeper plays at tight end this week after the injury to Dallas Clark in Week 12. Utecht contributed one reception for 18 yards in the defeat.\n\nKellen Winslow, Jr. contributed his lone catch of the day in overtime to help the Browns defeat Kansas City, but that's small consolation for fantasy owners expecting a big effort in the showdown against Tony Gonzalez. Winslow, Jr. was targeted just three times on the day and finished with one reception.\n\nLaveranues Coles commanded extra attention from the Green Bay secondary and was limited to three receptions for 28 yards in the blowout win. This game marked his lowest reception and yardage totals since Week 5. Coles has now finished five games with 40 or fewer receiving yards this season (four 100-yard games).\n\nRookie receiver Greg Jennings started the season strong, but has struggled of late. He has not scored since Week 5 and was limited to two receptions for 14 yards against the Jets. Jennings has accrued 50 or fewer receiving yards in five of six games in which he's played since the Packers' Week 5 bye.\n\nAfter a monster performance in Week 11, Lee Evans has been quieted in two consecutive games. Evans caught five passes for 45 yards in the loss after catching five passes for 58 yards in Week 12. He has tallied fewer than 60 receiving yards in six games this season.\n\nDrew Brees had carried fantasy owners for weeks, so it's hard to put him in the Flops column following Sunday's win. However, Brees contributed only 186 passing yards and one touchdown (on a shovel pass to Bush) in this all-important Week 13 matchup.\n\nTo that end, Devery Henderson jumped in the rankings boards ahead of this contest with word that Marques Colston would sit this one out. Henderson responded with two catches for 14 yards. He's hit big in two weeks and swung and missed twice.\n\nFellow New Orleans receiver Terrance Copper was shut out altogether after scoring in three consecutive games.\n\nThis weekend's performance takes nothing away from the tremendous season offered by Frank Gore, but he was silenced by the New Orleans defense in this huge spot. Gore carried the ball 13 times for 40 yards and added five receptions for 28 yards. It was a decent effort for those in point-per-reception leagues, but a minimal effort elsewhere.\n\nSan Francisco quarterback Alex Smith completed 50 percent of his pass attempts for 171 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions in the loss. He has thrown five interceptions against two touchdowns in his last two games. Smith last topped 200 passing yards in Week 6.\n\nSammy Morris of the Dolphins couldn't build on his strong Thanksgiving Day performance in place of injured starter Ronnie Brown. Morris carried the ball 12 times for 47 yards in the loss to Jacksonville.\n\nTexans quarterback David Carr rolled up 300 yards last week in a loss to the Jets, but he posted only 32 passing yards against the Raiders on Sunday. Andre Johnson caught one pass for nine yards. After subtracting the yardage from five sacks recorded by Oakland, the Texans generated minus-5 yards in passing offense and won.\n\nTake nothing away from the ability of Tony Romo and the beauty of his 42-yard strike to Jason Witten to set up the game-winning field goal. But, Romo was unable to continue his fantasy magic on Sunday. He completed 20-of-34 pass attempts for 257 yards and two early interceptions.\n\nDallas receiver Terry Glenn was also quiet in the hard-fought game, contributing four receptions for 52 yards in the win.\n\nJulius Jones played a minimal role in Sunday's win over the Giants. He rushed 11 times for 24 yards and caught one pass for 11 yards. It appears the Marion Barber III is supplanting Jones as the top option in the Dallas backfield down the stretch, as he's forced an equitable split of the workload in recent weeks.\n\nThe Steelers entered the game banged-up in the secondary, but Bruce Gradkowski was unable to find success downfield. He completed 20-of-34 attempts for 175 yards, took five sacks and threw three interceptions. Joey Galloway caught only three passes for 37 yards.\n\nGradkowski's struggles tie directly back to the team's inability to consistently run the ball. Carnell Williams rushed 11 times for 27 yards and added four receptions for 30 yards. He also lost a fumble on the day and has now rushed for fewer than 50 yards in seven games this season. Williams has scored only once all year.\n\nSteelers running back Willie Parker continues to struggle as fantasy owners approach the playoffs. He carried the ball 22 times for a meager 61 yards (2.8 yards per carry) and added one reception for 25 yards. Parker next faces the Browns on Thursday night.\n\nSeattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completed 16-of-28 attempts for a pedestrian 168 yards with one interception in the 23-20 win over Denver. Hasselbeck looked shaky at times, and later in the game, Mike Holmgren went away from the pass in several manageable third-down situations. He did narrowly miss a touchdown when Darrell Jackson was downed at the one on a fourth-quarter pass. Keep an eye on Hasselbeck in practice as the week unfolds.\n\nDeion Branch tallied just three receptions for 23 yards in the win.\n\nCutler delivered in his first start, but Javon Walker was a non-factor on Sunday night. Walker caught two balls for 17 yards as Denver re-established the running game."

      "source": "The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is the largest and most prestigious event in the advertising and marketing industries, drawing in thousands of attendees to drink ros\u00e9 on the banks of the French Riviera and celebrate the year\u2019s best work.\n\nFor attendees, the week in the south of France doesn\u2019t come cheap\u2014which is good news for the conference business.\n\nAscential ASCL -0.60 % PLC, the parent company of the Cannes Lions festival, went public on the London Stock Exchange LSE 0.00 % in February, offering a glimpse into the famed advertising event\u2019s financials for the first time.\n\nThe Cannes Lions festival generated \u00a342.5 million ($61.5 million) in revenue for 2015, up 3.7% from the prior year\u2019s event, according to the annual report for Ascential published in April. Excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, Cannes Lions\u2019 revenue would have risen 18% from 2014.\n\nThe annual report didn\u2019t disclose profits for Cannes Lions. Ascential\u2019s exhibitions and festivals segment, which includes Cannes Lions, had an adjusted operating profit of \u00a354.7 million ($79.1 million) for 2015.\n\nThe annual event primarily makes money from award entry fees and tickets, which together represented 83% of the event\u2019s revenues in 2015, according to an Ascential analyst presentation in April. Entry fees, excluding late fees, for this year\u2019s awards ranged from \u20ac499 to \u20ac1,399 each ($565 to $1583).\n\n\u201cThe growth of the festival really I think is an indication of just how complex marketing is at the moment,\u201d said Lions Festivals Chief Executive Philip Thomas. \u201cCannes is a place that people come to try and understand that [complexity] and see the greatest work in the world that\u2019s being created in different mediums.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming Cannes Lions festival, to be held from June 18 to June 25, includes a high-profile line up of agency CEOs, chief marketing officers, tech executives and popular celebrities for workshops, presentations, networking sessions and award presentations. Last year\u2019s event had 9,531 paying delegates and more than 40,000 entries from 90 countries, \u201ccementing its position as the \u2018must attend\u2019 and \u2018must enter\u2019 festival for the branded communications industry,\u201d according to Ascential\u2019s annual report.\n\nThere are various ticket packages for attendees depending on access level and duration. For example, a \u201cclassic\u201d pass\u2014which includes eight days of full access to talks, awards and networking at Cannes Lions and access to the specialist events, Cannes Innovation and Cannes Entertainment, costs \u20ac3,050 ($3,452). An eight-day \u201ccomplete gold\u201d ticket, which comes with line-skip privileges at mainstage talks and awards ceremonies and VIP access to the opening and closing galas, costs \u20ac5,050 ($5,716). There are lower priced ticket options for attendees who only want to attend the social and networking events and for professionals under the age of 30.\n\n\u201cFor the volume and the value that you get, I question whether that\u2019s a high price at all,\u201d Mr. Thomas said of the festival\u2019s ticket prices. \u201cWhen people attend or when they partner with us they tend to see the value very quickly. That value is clearly something that they want to repeat year on year on year.\u201d\n\nAgencies can spend several hundreds of thousands of dollars more on other Cannes-related expenses, such as travel and accommodation for attendees, parties and speaker fees, people familiar with the matter said. On top of that, many agencies have dedicated staff to strategize and prepare Cannes entries and promote campaigns ahead of the festival.\n\nAbout 9% of Cannes Lions\u2019 revenue last year came from sponsorships, or fees paid by companies to promote their businesses during the events, according to the April analyst presentation. Sponsorships can range from $10,000 to a couple hundred thousand dollars, Mr. Thomas said. The remaining 8% of Cannes Lions revenue last year came from services, which include trophy sales and an online archive of historic entries, the presentation said.\n\nAccording to Ascential\u2019s annual report, new delegate propositions and new forms of sponsorship at Cannes Lions have contributed to the business media and events company\u2019s organic growth for the year. To help reach new customers and deepen its product coverage, Cannes Lions has added show extensions such as Lions Health, an event launched in 2014 that is focused on health-care communications, and Lions Innovation, an event launched last year focused on data and technology specialists in the creative space. This year, Cannes Lions is presenting a new event, Lions Entertainment, which is focused on branded entertainment.\n\nThe festival is the largest event owned by Ascential, whose portfolio includes fashion information provider WGSN and trade shows such as Money 20/20 and the Spring and Autumn Fairs. Cannes Lions represented 13% of Ascential\u2019s total revenue last year.\n\nAscential\u2019s shares in London have increased 27% since its February IPO. It has a market capitalization of roughly \u00a31.02 billion ($1.47 billion).\n\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com"

      "source": "You\u2019re rounding the corner toward retirement age with not nearly enough set aside.\n\nWe tell young people to start saving for retirement from their first job and not to quit, because even small sums can grow staggeringly large with enough decades of compound returns. But maybe you bumped along from paycheck to paycheck, never saving much. Or maybe you tried to save but got slammed with unexpected setbacks like a late-in-life job loss.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: You can\u2019t make up for lost time.\n\nBut don\u2019t give up \u2014 you do have options. Any money you can set aside can help you make retirement more comfortable. Here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nThis means working longer, working part time in retirement or both. You\u2019ll have more time to save, your savings will have more time to grow, and you\u2019ll shorten the full-retirement period you\u2019ll need to cover. That\u2019s a nice way to say you\u2019ll have fewer work-free years before you die.\n\nIf working longer in your current job feels like a death sentence, start looking around for paying gigs you might enjoy in retirement. Working longer may have an upside: People who voluntarily work in retirement often say their jobs keep them active and engaged.\n\nIf you start taking Social Security benefits before your full retirement age \u2014 which is currently 66 and rising to 67 for people born in 1960 and later \u2014 the \u201cearnings test\u201d will reduce your benefit by $1 for every $2 you earn over a certain limit ($15,720 in 2016). That reduction will end when you hit full retirement age.\n\nRead More: 1 in 3 Americans Has Saved $0 for Retirement\n\nThe benefits of waiting are so great that it may be worth tapping whatever retirement funds you have so you can hold out until your full retirement age. If you sign up at age 62, you\u2019ll lock in a permanently reduced check.\n\nMost people are better off delaying their application at least until their full retirement age, currently 66 but rising to 67 for people born in 1960 or later. That would inflate a $1,500 monthly benefit to at least $2,000. If you waited until age 70, when benefits max out, the same check would grow to about $2,640 each month.\n\nIf you\u2019re married, it\u2019s particularly important for the higher earner to put off applying for as long as possible. When one of you dies, the survivor will get the larger of the two benefits you received as a couple. Maximizing that benefit can help keep the survivor\u2019s final years from being a financial nightmare.\n\nRule of thumb: Every year you wait past age 62 adds about 7% to 8% to your eventual benefit.\n\nRead More: The True Cost of a Bounced Check\n\nIf you have substantial home equity, you have a powerful asset to deploy for your retirement. You can:\n\nNew Jersey resident Walt Lukasik, 60, is investigating this option to salvage retirement plans that were upended by his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis 15 years ago. She hasn\u2019t been able to work for the past eight years, and medical bills have sucked away any money they\u2019d hoped to save, Lukasik says.\n\nThe combination of caregiving and worrying about retirement is taking its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s killing me,\u201d he says.\n\nIf he applies for a reverse mortgage in two years, it could pay off the $75,000 balance on their current mortgage and give them a monthly payment of about $390, according to the National Reverse Lenders Mortgage Association. If he waits until the mortgage is paid off in five years, the monthly payment would be closer to $800. Other payout options include a lump sum of $93,000 or a line of credit of more than $160,000.\n\nReverse mortgages are complex and can be costly, so they\u2019re not a good fit for every situation. Counseling is mandatory and typically provided by nonprofit credit counseling agencies.\n\nRead More: Everyday Investors Should Avoid Alternative Investments\n\nMost U.S. parents are horrified by the notion of asking their children for money. Their kids often don\u2019t feel the same way. A recent survey by Fidelity Investments found nine out of 10 parents think it would be unacceptable to become financially dependent on their offspring, but only three out of 10 adult children agreed with them.\n\nIf there\u2019s any chance you may need your children to help you make ends meet, consider having the conversation sooner rather than later. Bringing up the issue may be painful and embarrassing. But at least you\u2019ll know whether you can rely on their help, and they will have time to rearrange their finances to better offer it \u2014 while, of course, saving for their own retirement.\n\nIf worse comes to worst, Social Security alone can keep you above the poverty line \u2014 that\u2019s why it was invented. You also may qualify for public benefits, such as subsidized housing, food benefits and lower-cost utilities. Start your search at Benefits.gov.\n\nIf consumer debt such as credit cards, medical bills and unsecured personal loans totals half or more of your gross income, explore your debt-relief options, including talking with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. You may be better off saving that money than using it to chip away at debt you can\u2019t ultimately repay.\n\nRead More: Key Financial Considerations for Your Encore Career\n\nYou don\u2019t need a fortune. You do need a way to deal with an emergency or the flexibility to time your benefits better. Anything you can save will give you more choices in retirement. Having $10,000 in a savings account could pay for a new furnace or an unexpected medical bill. Boosting your savings more could allow you to delay Social Security or the start of a pension to get bigger checks.\n\nThis option is a long shot, but it may work for those with sufficient income to make a last, aggressive push to save for retirement.\n\nYou may be able to save a big chunk of your income if you\u2019re entering the empty nest years and can funnel into retirement accounts money that you used to spend on raising and educating kids. Or maybe you\u2019re just determined to slash expenses and buckle down to serious saving.\n\nLet\u2019s say you earn around $45,000. According to Social Security, your benefit at full retirement age will replace roughly 40% of what you make, or about $18,000 a year. Saving 20% to 30% of your income during your last 15 years of work could give you a nest egg big enough to prevent your lifestyle from falling off a cliff in retirement. (This assumes that you can manage a 6% average annual return, inflation averages 3% and that you\u2019ll live on about 60% to 70% of your pre-retirement income for 20 years.)\n\nIf you\u2019re able to pull this off \u2014 and that\u2019s a big if \u2014 you can go a long way toward closing the retirement gap."

      "supported-summary-entities": [],
      "source": "An equity-indexed annuity (EIA) is an alternative savings plan for conservative investors. It can come as an immediate or deferred annuity, so the periodic payments promised in the contract are delayed. An investor may take on more risk compared to fixed or variable annuities. The returns are linked to the performance of a particular stock market index, often the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The performance also depends on the terms of the contract. However, these instruments have the benefit of more potential return while providing the traditional benefits of being an annuity.\n\nEIA History These annuities came onto the scene in the 1990s and have been sold at insurance companies. They follow the rise in stock market values and are considered an investment that could help seniors, who were able to ensure that their money was protected and growing, with their retirement income needs.\n\nThe investment tool's popularity soon took off at the turn of the millennium, with sales in the billions. The industry changed and the annuities became more complex. The tools had a variety of fees and charges, limitations on accumulation, calculations of index values, along with some other features.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2004 alone, sales doubled, going from $14 billion to nearly $22 billion, respectively. Sales were nearly $25 billion in 2007. In June 2008 more than $123 billion was invested in indexed annuities, Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, stated at the time. Sales increased 45% in the first six months of 2009.\n\nIn 2008 the Securities Exchange Commission cracked down on the abusive sales practices used to promote the product to seniors. An inquiry at a national seniors summit revealed that EIAs were among the securities involved in senior investment fraud. The SEC worked on a new rule that would consider EIAs securities, and therefore would have protections afforded by the securities law.\n\nEIAs Differ from the Other Types of Annuities An EIA's return is more interchangeable than a fixed annuity's, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), but this isn't the case when compared to a variable annuity; the return is not as much. The guaranteed interest rate is at a minimum; although, it's combined with an interest rate linked to a market index. It's the guaranteed interest rate that lessens their market risk; this differs from variable annuities. Also, when the stock market rises these investments are likely to have more gains than traditional fixed annuities.\n\nThe most common features that impact the return on equity-linked annuities are the participation rates, the spread, margin and asset fee, and the interest rate caps. Participation rates determine the amount of gain in the index that will be credited to the annuity. This would mean, for example, that if an insurance company sets the participation rate at 90%, the annuity would only be credited 90% of the gain.\n\nA spread, margin or asset fee in addition to, or instead of, a participation rate are sometimes used with these types of annuities, and the percentage will be taken away from any gain in the index linked to the annuity, according to FINRA. Some EIAs will restrict the upper limit on your return, according to FINRA.\n\nThe typical methods in which the equity insurance annuities are calculated include the annual reset method, the point-to-point method and the high-water-mark method. The annual rest method looks at the changes in the index from the beginning to the end of the year, while neglecting declines; the point-to-point method looks at the change in the index at two points in time; the high-water mark approach narrows in on the index value at typically the annual anniversaries and takes the highest of these values and compares it to the index level at the start of the term."

FIFA as the world governing body of football wants that money back and we are determined to get it no matter how long it takes.\u201d\n\nIn documents seen by the Associated Press, FIFA asks for:\n\n\u2022 $28.2 million for years of payments, including bonuses, flights and daily expenses, to officials it now says are corrupt\n\n\u2022 $10 million for the \u201ctheft\u201d of money that FIFA officials transferred as bribes to then-executive committee members to vote for South Africa as 2010 World Cup host\n\n\u2022 \u201csubstantial\u201d cost of legal bills since separate US and Swiss federal probes of corruption in international soccer were revealed last May\n\n\u2022 damages for harm to its reputation, plus other bribes and kickbacks for media rights to non-FIFA competitions but \u201cwhich were made possible because of the value of the FIFA brand\u201d\n\n\u201cFIFA has become notable for the defendants\u2019 bribery and corruption, not its many good works,\u201d lawyers for soccer\u2019s world body state in the claim. \u201cFIFA is entitled to restitution for this harm to its business relationships, reputation and intangible property.\u201d\n\nFIFA\u2019s grab for a share of the money sets up a battle with two of its regional confederations \u2014 CONMEBOL, the South American confederation, and CONCACAF, the body running soccer in North America. It was officials and competitions from those regions that were most involved in the corruption crisis.\n\nIt also signals a change in strategy for FIFA, after months of senior officials distancing Zurich from the scandal, instead blaming confederations which are beyond its control.\n\nMost of the already seized money \u2014 $151.7 million \u2014 will come from Brazilian marketing executive Jose Hawilla, whose group of agencies were heavily involved with matches CONCACAF and CONMEBOL controlled but not FIFA directly.\n\nIn an initial claim for $28.2 million, FIFA specifies an amount for each of 20 men from the Americas over many years that it says it should be repaid from money held by US authorities.\n\nFIFA wants more than $5.3 million it spent on Chuck Blazer, the disgraced American official who has pleaded guilty, allocates $4.4 million of its claim for former FIFA vice president Jack Warner, and $3.5 million for Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange\u2019s former son-in-law from Brazil.\n\nWarner, a long-time powerbroker from Trinidad and Tobago until resigning in a 2011 election bribery scandal, is identified by FIFA in its 22-page claim for receiving a $1 million bribe from 1998 World Cup bid candidate Morocco, and ensuring the $10 million bribe from South Africa was paid via a FIFA account in 2008.\n\nFIFA claims a further $2 million for payments to Jeffrey Webb, the Cayman Islands banker who was arrested at a luxury Zurich hotel last May, and now lives at his home near Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting sentencing in June.\n\n\u201cThese dollars were meant to build football fields, not mansions and pools; to buy football kits, not jewelry and cars; and to fund youth player and coach development, not to underwrite lavish lifestyles for football and sports marketing executives,\u201d Infantino said.\n\nIt is unclear how much influence Infantino, a former lawyer, had in the restitution claim since he was elected only three weeks ago, with strong support from voters in the Americas.\n\nInfantino\u2019s signature pitch to voters on election day was about finances, saying bluntly \u201cIt\u2019s your money.\u201d That resonated with members of CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, who have had a combined $20 million in central funding frozen by FIFA.\n\nCONCACAF, based in Miami, has had its past three presidents implicated in the US case. But it has passed wide-ranging reforms to clean up its operations, and has targeted restitution money to rebuild.\n\n\u201cCONCACAF views itself as a victim of a number of the offenses described in the indictments and intends to seek restitution at the appropriate time,\u201d the regional body said in a statement."

      "source": "MySpace layouts is now the world\u2019s 9th most popular search term, according to the latest data coming out of Hitwise. We\u2019ve already seen how huge the market is around feeding the MySpace beast (creating Flash widgets for social networking profiles), but MySpace layouts are also a massive driver of traffic. In fact, these sites are growing at about the same rate as MySpace itself - while the market share of visits to MySpace increased by 60% over the last 6 months, visits to the Hitwise \u201cWeb Development\u201d category have increased by 57% over the same period. The top sites are no doubt making big bucks from their ad-supported business models.\n\nDesigners will also be overjoyed to learn that 9 of the top 10 web development sites in the world create MySpace layouts and flashing gifs. Additionally, it\u2019s interesting to note that the top players are not simply those that have the highest Google ranking for \u201cMySpace Layouts\u201d (although there is some correlation).\n\nSo who are the big winners here? I thought I\u2019d do a quick, easy-to-read, fun-for-all-the-family round up of the Top 10 companies in this booming sector. The following are ranked by market share.\n\nThe number one player, FreeWebLayouts, serves up fairly attractive off-the-shelf layouts. They\u2019ve also made the process incredibly simple - click on any profile you like and you\u2019ll instantly get some code to paste into your MySpace page. Popular backgrounds tend to include celebrities and movie imagery. It strikes me that this could be a huge opportunity for the movie studios: pay FreeWebLayouts to create and distribute a layout for your movie right before it comes out in theaters. It would be a cheap grassroots effort and could generate a large amount of buzz.\n\nFreeWebLayouts also has a profile creator that lets users develop their own customized MySpace layouts - not to mention the hundreds of buttons, banners and add-ons that are available. Obviously all these elements will all link back to FreeWebLayouts when inserted into your MySpace profile - resulting in masses of traffic from MySpace.\n\nThe second biggest player in this market provides MySpace backgrounds and graphics with TV and music themes. What\u2019s more, you can quickly grab the \u201cMySpace codes\u201d to drop into your site. HotFreeLayouts boasts that it has over 6,000 different layouts available, as well as customizable \u201cMySpace banners\u201d, animated gifs and polls. In fact, polls are another massively popular MySpace add-on - they\u2019re provided by many of the top players. Additionally, you\u2019ll notice that HotFreeLayouts has an extremely sparse (some might say ugly) design. This is a crucial point: when building tools for MySpace, your website design isn\u2019t all that important.\n\nAs if to contradict my last point, the number three player is actually very well designed. The pink and gray site serves up some of the most annoying MySpace additions imaginable - pop-up windows, glitter text, falling objects to overlay on your page and custom scrollbar colors. But they also offer some neat stuff: the ability to quickly clone a MySpace layout you like, for instance.\n\nLike all these sites, PimpYourPro has diversified beyond MySpace layouts - they also offer video codes (ala YouTube) and games, seemingly through partnerships with other sites. A service like Bunchball should seriously consider partnering with one of these services to increase adoption. In fact, anyone who is feeding the MySpace beast should make contact with all of these companies ASAP and try to strike a distribution deal.\n\nIn at number four is FreeCodeSource, sporting a totally tasteless design and plenty of bling. You can\u2019t even begin to explain the number of items on offer - from MySpace layouts to generators, graphics, animations, \u201cMySpace cursors\u201d, comment images, buttons, posters, banners and more. And of course they\u2019ve done some MySpace marketing (the new name for Branding 2.0) by asking users to add FreeCodeSource to their friends on MySpace.\n\nThe fifth site in this category isn\u2019t really about MySpace layouts at all - instead, Blogthings provides quizzes to embed in your MySpace page. These include \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Vampire Name?\u201d, \u201cWhat Superhero Are You?\u201d and \u201cAre You Bipolar?\u201d. The page owner answers these questions then posts the results to his MySpace page - the idea is that this gives you some insight into the user\u2019s personality.\n\nAdditionally, Blogthings generates custom html code for LiveJournal, Xanga, Facebook, MSN Spaces (aka Windows Live Spaces) and forums. Another important point is that Blogthings offers multiple ways for users to be notified of new stuff. Members can subscribe in MyYahoo, Xanga, MyAOL and LiveJournal. A basic RSS feed is also offered, but I doubt it sees much usage.\n\nThe sixth player is a 70s-styled directory and guide that seems to be built on a blogging platform. Instead of producing MySpace layouts and banners, WhateverLife provides advice and help on installing your layouts, producing overlapping text, creating tables and more. In many ways, it\u2019s an html coding guide reinvented for the MySpace generation. This is a whole \u2018nother market to tap: the huge number of MySpace users who are struggling with html coding.\n\nThe seventh most popular site aims to build \u201cthe largest selection of Myspace Layouts, Myspace Codes, Myspace Cursors, and Myspace Graphics for girls\u201d. Like most of these services, MyGirlySpace is an odd mishmash of many different add-ons, with some celebrity gossip thrown in just for fun. Additions include scrolling text, Flash animations, a CD cover generator and a selection of \u201cMySpace cursors\u201d. They also link to partner sites and affiliates fairly heavily, making it hard to tell what\u2019s an affiliate link and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAt number eight is FreeFlashToys - and judging by the design, they\u2019re still partying like it\u2019s 1999. The service provides Flash \u201ctoys\u201d like away messages, lava lamps and comment graphics. They also supply a large number of \u201ctrains\u201d - I wasn\u2019t able to dig too deeply into these, but they seem to be a way to add masses of friends to your MySpace profile very quickly.\n\nFreeFlashToys also has a cunning MySpace-specific affiliate scheme: if you put a \u201cFreeFlashToys promoter\u201d button on your MySpace page, the site will count the number of visitors you refer. The top referrers get featured on FreeFlashToys, presumably earning them more attention and friend requests. This is a really interesting trend: MySpacers will happily advertise your product for free if you can help them gain more friends. Does this have any consequences for sites like MyPickList, which is offering cash in exchange for product promotion? Definitely something to think about.\n\nAt number nine is Memegen, one of the leading providers of quizzes for MySpace and LiveJournal. The crucial point here is that Memegen is not generating most of these quizzes - instead, it provides the tools for users to create their own custom quizzes and share them with other others. To put it another way, Memegen does virtually no work and yet is one of the leading providers of content to MySpace. In common with Blogthings, users answer a series of questions on a certain topic that supposedly reveal something about that person\u2019s personality.\n\nNot to be confused with RockYou, the MySpace slideshow creator, BlinkYou provides MySpace layouts, glitter images, \u201conline now\u201d icons, a doll maker, cursors, backgrounds and more for MySpace users. There\u2019s also a fairly clunky MySpace Layout Generator that provides a live preview while you\u2019re customizing your page. But unlike the others, BlinkYou feels like an old-style forum: visitors can leave messages in the shoutbox and there\u2019s a constantly-updated display of how many users are currently on the site. At the time of writing, that figure is 1153 - another reminder that MySpace layouts are an absolutely huge market. What\u2019s more, the site reports 327,435,448 hits. Yowsers.\n\nMySpace layouts and so-called \u201cMySpace codes\u201d are a huge, huge market - perhaps even bigger than the market for MySpace widgets. What\u2019s more, I doubt this is a winner-takes-all game - there\u2019s a huge long tail of sites providing friend adders, virtual pets and many more MySpace additions. However, it should also be noted that many (probably most) of these sites are full of scams, spam and adware (see MySpace Codes Bring Adware Payload). As a result, Googling \u201cMySpace layouts\u201d is probably an unwise move.\n\nSee also: MySpace, America\u2019s Number One.\n\nWeb 2.0, myspace, youtube, myspace layouts"

      "source": "'I think we should all,\" Jon Hamm suggests, \"get a chance to spend a week or two back in the shoes of our 24-year-old self\u2026\" Hamm, straight-jawed star of Mad Men, is talking in his rich bass voice about the premise of A Young Doctor's Notebook, an inspired adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov's autobiographical tales of his apprenticeship as a doctor in rural Russia in 1916. In the drama, now entering its second series on Sky Arts, Hamm plays the middle-aged writer, looking back on the bleakly comic, steppe-back-in-time world of his youth, through the person of Daniel Radcliffe. The pair \u2013 the morphine-addicted 42-year-old dissident, and the naive 24-year-old medic \u2013 get to compare notes periodically, a set-up which among other things allowed the perfectly surreal spectacle at one point in the first, four-part series, of Don Draper sharing an antique copper bath with Harry Potter.\n\nThe adaptation was Hamm's idea, and he was instrumental in getting Radcliffe, who is a full foot shorter than him, as his innocent mini-me. With a passing facial resemblance, they make a likeable deadpan double act, one in which even the height difference feels right: \"You think of your younger self as smaller and less worldly and more prone to making mistakes,\" Hamm says, \"and anyway we are not dealing with realism here. You buy into it because neither can you talk to your older self in the bathtub.\" The harder challenge of the series lies in its delicate, mordant tone, which shifts quickly from shop of horrors medical emergency, to poignant reminiscence, to escapist slapstick. Think M*A*S*H meets Chekhov. Hamm is often faced with the challenge of conveying all those registers at once in his advice to the flailing, amputating, Radcliffe: \"You just might have to settle for saving the world three-quarters of a peasant at a time,\" he will say.\n\n\"We didn't want it to be some dry historical drama,\" Hamm suggests, \"but nor did we want to it to be a David Lynch artsy thing.\" We are talking after a day's shooting, in a deserted canteen at the show's studio in Twickenham. Hamm read, he says, a lot of Russian literature back when he was a student in Texas, \"from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn\", and came away from most of it thinking primarily: \"Wow! Russia is a very different place from the midwest.\" You could, he says, just about imagine yourself there, but not that easily. He wanted the series to carry that alien sense, \"a bit like how Americans feel about Downton Abbey\".\n\nHe'd met Radcliffe at various awards ceremonies and parties. (It was a bonus that the Harry Potter star turned out to be an ardent fan of Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita.) \"A couple of my friends had worked with Dan. And I knew he would spark to it,\" Hamm says. \"He is incredibly dedicated, and not afraid to slip and fall and make a fool of himself, which is everything you want in an actor. He is off working on stage in the evenings while we are doing this [in The Cripple of Inishmaan at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre in London's West End] So: the perfect crazy 24-year-old.\"\n\nThe adaptation, is, among other things, I suggest, the ideal vehicle for the pair of them to be cast against their respective indelible types. Having spent six series as Don Draper, Hamm is beginning to imagine life without his impeccably tailored, semi-psychotic alter ego, who he will leave behind for good when series seven concludes in 2015. He doesn't see his current months off-set specifically as a holiday from Draper, he says, but he does go out of his way to find parts for himself where \"he is not playing a philanderer\" \u2013 though of course those are the parts that he mostly gets offered. \"In that sense I am not unlike Mr Radcliffe. Our names tend to come with something attached \u2013 an audience and an expectation, and I guess a price tag. The challenge is to choose the right things to do.\"\n\nThe fascination with Hamm as an actor, one understood exactly by Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner, is that in all of his parts he appears to have arrived seamless and fully formed. The opening line of the first show of Mad Men asked the question \"Who is Don Draper?\" and those millions of \"Maddicts\" who have stuck with it are still obsessed by the answer.\n\nWeiner imagined the Draper character as a Gatsby figure, the American archetype of the self-made hero with the tragic flaw. When he auditioned Hamm, he saw immediately what he had been looking for: an old-style Hollywood leading man, a Cary Grant or a Gregory Peck, an iconic adult male, but one who might convey both an intellect and a kind of emptiness, an emotional space to be filled. When Hamm left the room after his first audition, Weiner famously turned to his casting director and said, with certainty, \"That man was not raised by his parents.\" Even now, off-duty, in a sweatshirt, and nursing a cold, he carries something of that quality about him; he is open and charming and quick to laugh, but also unfathomably self-contained in some way. If, I ask him at one point, he was in a bath with his own 24-year-old self, what would he be telling him?\n\nHamm smiles at the idea. \"I'd be telling him, just work harder. I had been doing plays back then. At 24, I'd just come to Los Angeles.\" He'd arrived in his beaten-up Toyota, with about 100 dollars stuffed into his jeans pocket, all his worldly goods. \"When you think of yourself in your 20s you tend to obscure some of the worst memories and inflate some of the good parts,\" he says. \"If I think back to my first couple of months as a professional actor, I cringe: I was such an idiot. In film and television there are so many customs that you don't know about. You just blunder in.\"\n\nBy 24, Hamm had done a great deal of enforced growing up. Born in St Louis, Missouri, he was two when his parents divorced; he lived with his mother and saw his father at the weekend. His mother had moved to St Louis from a small town in Kansas at 18 to work as a secretary. She met and married Dan Hamm, an older widower who already had two daughters. Hamm's father weighed more than 20 stone and was nicknamed \"the whale\" on account of his gargantuan personality as well as his girth. After his haulage business failed he sold cars, and tried his hand at advertising. When Hamm was 10 his mother died quite suddenly of stomach cancer. He was given a book, How to Deal with the Death of a Parent, and he moved into a house that his father shared with his own mother.\n\nIt was not a happy home, and Hamm escaped into sport \u2013 he was a serious baseball player \u2013 and increasingly into the theatre. He won a scholarship to Texas University. During his first term, his grandmother died, and during his second, on New Year's Day 1991, his father, who suffered from diabetes, also passed away. Hamm was 20, and, I imagine, suddenly profoundly rootless?\n\n\"Not rootless,\" he says, \"but certainly not rooted. If you are in that situation you tend to cling on to people and cling on to things. For a few years I lived in a bunch of basements and on a bunch of couches, and had a lot of surrogate families around St Louis and Columbia, Missouri. A lot of those people are still in my life and that is a nice thing to have. It's maybe the occasional email \u2013 I don't do Facebook or Twitter or any of that shit \u2013 rather than a face-to-face meeting, but I keep up with people.\"\n\nThe cliche is that acting provides a family, and Hamm is not going to argue.\n\n\"We used to joke that the theatre department at college was where all the orphans ended up,\" he says. \"They had been kicked out of every other place, but they found a role, a place there, whether it was front of house, or on the stage. That doesn't mean it wasn't bitchy and catty and competitive at times \u2013 like any family. But it took all comers.\"\n\nWhat was the moment, I wonder, when he knew for sure that was where he belonged?\n\n\"It really started at high school,\" he suggests, \"when one of my teachers, who is still a good friend, took me on one side and said: 'You are really good at this.' I still have problems with compliments. But that was the first one, and I kept hearing that as I carried on. I never really heard it in any other arena, no one ever said you are a really good writer, or you are good at math. And, as you say, I later found myself unrooted. I had no immediate family, no wife, no particular place to live, so I thought I might as well give this life a try. I've learned a few things, but one is: you are only 24 once. You have to hustle a bit to get where you want to be.\"\n\nFor a long while, living initially with his aunt and uncle in LA and later with friends, Hamm did the rounds of audition and rejection. He kept working \u2013 albeit at one point briefly as a set designer on a soft-porn film. It was not until 2000, at 29, that he got his first TV part, in a forgettable series called Providence; and when Mad Men came around in 2007, he was still scratching around for regular work, by now the other half of Jennifer Westfeld who had given him a role in the 2001 hit comedy Kissing Jessica Stein which she had written, and in which she starred. Given that he had to wait for it, his stellar Mad Men years must still feel a bit like the most surprising of plot twists?\n\n\"It is. I mean, the stated career objective was just to work and pay off my college loans. Anything else would be gravy. I never wanted to be Tom Cruise or whatever. I just wanted to work on things I liked and to avoid douchebags. Thankfully that's how it worked out.\"\n\nAll men measure themselves against their father to some degree. When he started out as Don Draper Hamm would apparently keep a picture of his larger-than-life old man on his wall. In one early Mad Men interview he remembered looking at himself in the mirror the first time he put on one of Draper's trademark suits. \"I was sitting in my dressing room,\" he recalled, \"running lines in the mirror, and I thought: Oh, my God! I look just like my father. He was just so fucking sad. Here's this guy that looks like he's got the whole package, but there\"s nothing inside but sadness.\"\n\nDoes he still feel that ever-present absence?\n\n\"I do,\" he says. \"I mean I lost my dad when I was 20, and I realise now I never really had any what you might call adult conversations with him. There was a lot unspoken. I never heard how he met my mum for example. Or any stories about his childhood or much of what he had done before I was around. I had my own experience of him, but a kid's experience of watching his father is not necessarily the reality. I can see a resemblance in myself to my father, although of course I hope I keep my hair and don't gain 200lbs and don't get diabetes. He was an interesting guy, but a sad guy. He lost the two women he loved. It was pretty tough.\"\n\nWatching Mad Men over the years it has always felt that Hamm's own story is around the edges of Don's life, is he conscious of that?\n\n\"Yes. I think it's pretty close to the surface. I'm not shy about that. I think Matt Weiner and the writing staff have wisely mined that source for its dramatic motherlode so to speak.\"\n\nDoes he access that history when he is acting in certain scenes?\n\n\"No, I generally don't,\" he says. \"I'm not that methody. I am very cognisant that I am playing a character. Don Draper is a pretty dismal, despicable guy, so why I would want to take him home with me I don't know... It's a strange thing. People tell me they look up to Don, like they look up to Tony Soprano or Walter White [in Breaking Bad]. People have these weird fascinations with people who in reality you would not want to be for a second. There seems to be that vicarious thrill. Maybe it is the fact of doing everything wrong and getting away with it.\"\n\nPerhaps because of his childhood awareness of how badly things can go wrong in life, perhaps because of his proximity to Don Draper, Hamm has led an apparently blameless Hollywood existence, even since his alpha male fame. I interviewed Jennifer Westfeldt, his partner of 15 years, at the time her latest film, Friends With Kids, came out, and she spoke then of the disconcerting reality of being out and about with Hamm in recent years. \"The hardest bit for people,\" she said, \"is that Don Draper is such an iconic character that fans of the show have a really hard time imagining Jon is not like that. That he is really this goofball. And that he is in this long relationship. That is, I guess, why people come up and say all sorts of wildly inappropriate things to him, and me, which don't bear repeating. It never gets any less weird. It's like being with a Beatle or something.\"\n\nHamm routinely fares well in sexiest/best-dressed male lists in both straight and gay publications. Along with his multitude of Emmys, he is indisputably GQ's man of the year, every year. Is that something he enjoys?\n\n\"Well, it is and it isn't a good thing. If you are a guy who needs that kind of validation, more power to you. I'm not a guy who needs that. I find most of it silly. You can ask anyone who knows me if I walk around as cock of the walk, and I'd be amazed if anyone said that was the case. That kind of culture should be the preserve of teenage girls, and if you ask any 16-year-old girl, she'll say I remind her of her dad. You know, I am a 42-year-old guy in a world in which Ryan Gosling exists\u2026\"\n\nA comparative escape from some of that kind of attention is among the reasons Hamm enjoys working in Britain. He came here first as a chaperone for a theatre group from his old high school, his first trip abroad, aged 21. And though it was, he suggests, \"a truly terrible idea to put me in charge of 20 13- to 17-year-olds, I anyhow fell in love with England, Stonehenge and Bath and Oxford and all that. I still love being here \u2013 the way it is based around walking and biking. I can wander around quite happily in London. I am kind of out of context. And unless it is late and they are shitfaced most Brits are too polite to hassle me.\"\n\nWestfeldt is in New York, starring in a play. Hamm spent the summer in India, and in Atlanta, working on a Disney film about a baseball agent trying to hire cricket stars, so they have not seen much of each other. \"It's the usual story,\" he says, a reality which means among other things they have never felt the time right to have children (the mostly comic subject of Westfeldt's last film, in which Hamm also starred). When I asked Westfeldt about her thoughts on a family she said: \"I think kids should have something grounded. Jon and I are both children of divorce. I'm not sure we can do it without a proper home base.\" He agrees, suggesting St Louis would be a better place to raise children than either New York or LA, but that for them to move there would be like \"a Texan oilman moving to Hawaii\".\n\nSo it's not on the horizon? \"It is not imminent, let's put it that way.\" And Hamm has no plans to slow down in his career any time soon. At one point in our conversation, we talk about actors' lives he admires.\n\n\"I have no idea how Tom Cruise, say, can still be credible as an action hero, but he is,\" he suggests. \"That is crazy. I mean I have met him and he is a very intense guy: if there is one person on the planet who can carry that off for three decades it is probably him. But a guy like Jeff Bridges would be more my hero. He lives in Montecito, hangs out, and occasionally comes forward to do something great. I met him when he was nominated for an Academy Award for True Grit and I was totally starstruck, like a gibbering idiot, barely able to shake his hand.\"\n\nWhile I imagine for a moment Hamm tongue-tied in a tuxedo, I wonder if he has given much thought to Don Draper's eventual demise. Having lived with him so long is it something he would like a say in?\n\n\"Well, it hasn't been written yet,\" he says. \"But I have every possible faith in Matt [Weiner]. We have a meeting before every season starts and we sit and talk for an hour or two, not about specific things. Just chatting about what we did on holiday, what art we have seen, about sports or getting older or whatever. Just stuff that is on my mind. And he will write a bunch of things down from that conversation. I have no idea at all what the process is after that.\"\n\nHaving known intimately the loss of one family, I wonder how he will cope with losing the surrogates in Mad Men? Can he conceive of life without them?\n\n\"I hope so,\" he says. \"It has been a long stretch. If you look back at Don and Betty in series one, and how young the kids were, and how much more hair I had, you get a real sense of life passing; it's a bit like one of those Russian novels in that way. It has been a solid 25 per cent of my existence on the planet. But that's enough, I think.\" Hamm smiles his broad Don Draper grin.\n\n\"Will it be sad? Absolutely. I have made a lot of very close friends on the show. You know, I am feeling pretty zen about it just now, but probably next year I will be crying my eyes out.\"\n\nA Young Doctors' Notebook series 2 starts on Sky Arts 1 on Thursday, 9pm"

So even though there may have been a full pop-music generation separating the coheadlining bands\u2019 fanbases Friday at the Xfinity Center, it didn\u2019t matter. Everyone had the same inner 15-year-old coming out to party, regardless of which band they called theirs.\n\nWith only one lineup change since their breakthrough \u201cPyromania\u201d \u2014 out of necessity when guitarist Steve Clark died in 1991; they didn\u2019t even replace their drummer when he lost an arm \u2013 the members of Def Leppard are nothing if not loyal to the band. They\u2019re in it for the long haul, which may be why their approach didn\u2019t seem to have changed since 1988. There was no attempt to switch things up, save an acoustic \u201cBringin\u2019 On The Heartbreak\u201d that became the familiar full-electric version by the end anyway.\n\nThat meant that the anodized harmonies and precision-sculpted guitar parts of \u201cPhotograph\u201d and \u201cHysteria\u201d remained intact. So, too, did the genial idiocy hits like \u201cLet\u2019s Get Rocked.\u201d But at its best, like with \u201cPour Some Sugar On Me,\u201d idiocy was irrelevant. All they needed was a dead-simple, utterly indelible riff, a thunderous beat, and a guitar break that was practically holy writ by now. Def Leppard made no attempt to vary it.\n\nIn one of its signature songs, Kiss directly equates thunder and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, which explains plenty about the sludgy bulldozer thud powering most of its set. The band could be tight and even funny with \u201cRock And Roll All Nite\u201d and \u201cCalling Dr. Love,\u201d but \u201cHotter Than Hell,\u201d \u201cLick It Up,\u201d and many others were merely crude riffage attached to cruder songwriting.\n\nBut even with mostly uninspired material, Kiss was never, ever boring. Songs were simply delivery systems for showmanship, as when Paul Stanley and Tommy Thayer prowled the stage worshipfully as Gene Simmons, hoisted atop the spider-shaped rigging, raged \u201cGod Of Thunder\u201d from on high. And while Kiss drew mainly from the same box of tricks it\u2019s had for decades, there were all the explosions, spark-spitting guitars, and blood- and fire-spitting (and microphone-licking) bassists anyone could hope for.\n\nKobra And The Lotus\u2019s opening set offered operatic metal marked by singer Kobra Paige\u2019s throaty, well-supported vibrato and a tech crew that kept admirably to the schedule by dismantling the drums and amps before the band was finished playing them.\n\nRobert E. Klein for the Boston Globe\n\nDef Leppard with lead vocalist Joe Elliott at the Xfinity Center."

      "source": "BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- They were crimes born of the Internet age -- romantic solicitations on popular Web site Craigslist that police say led to the fatal shooting of one woman and the robbery of another in Boston hotels this past spring.\n\nInternet forensic expert Mark Rasch used high-tech sleuthing to help police in Boston's Craigslist crimes.\n\nAnd it was high-tech, 21st-century sleuthing, along with some old-fashioned gumshoe detective work, that put police on the trail toward a suspect and eventually an arrest.\n\nOn CNN's \"AC 360\" Randi Kaye recently took a behind-the-scenes look at how technology was used to lead police to 23-year-old medical student Philip Markoff, who has been indicted on seven counts, including first-degree murder.\n\nProsecutors said Julissa Brisman, a model from New York who advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, was shot three times at close range and suffered blunt head trauma at the Marriott Copley Place hotel on April 14. And a 29-year-old Las Vegas, Nevada, woman was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards at the Westin Copley Place hotel, police reports said. Read the AC360 blog post\n\nInvestigators knew they had crimes born of the Internet on their hands, but how were they able to use that same technology to help them find a suspect who went to great lengths to hide his tracks?\n\n\"The figures involved communicated with each other [via] text and e-mail, and they only met at the very last minute,\" said special correspondent Maureen Orth, who investigated the story for Vanity Fair magazine. \"And then the way the police were able to solve the crime was going back, using the clicks and the Internet addresses.\"\n\nIn Brisman's case, police knew she had communicated on Craigslist with a person calling himself \"Andy.\"\n\nMark Rasch once headed the computer crimes unit at the U.S. Department of Justice. Now an Internet forensic expert, he helped Boston police track the alleged killer.\n\n\"The first thing you start with was the e-mail address. In this case, it's an e-mail address from Live.com, which is Microsoft,\" Rasch explained to CNN's Kaye. Watch Randi Kaye's full report \u00bb\n\nRasch showed Kaye the tracer program he used to help follow the e-mails from \"Andy.\"\n\n\"Trace Back does what it says -- traces the route that the e-mail took on its way from its origin to the destination,\" Rasch said.\n\nRasch says police got the Internet protocol address for the e-mailer's computer. From there, investigators tracked down the company providing Internet service to the suspect, which told them that the subscriber lived in a Quincy apartment building, outside Boston.\n\nEven though police had what they believed was the killer's real name and home address, that still was not enough, Kaye reports.\n\n\"They have to validate and actually get this guy's fingers on the keyboard,\" Rasch said. \"So in the end, they reverted to the old gumshoe thing of a stakeout.\"\n\nPolice zeroed in on Markoff. They'd seen a tall, blond male they believed was the killer on the hotel surveillance cameras. And they did what many people do on a daily basis -- they Googled him.\n\nPolice learned their prime suspect was a medical student at Boston University. He was engaged to be married.\n\nAgain, the Internet helped. They got a better look at him through pictures with his fiancee online. It's a piece of a digital trail criminals rarely think about, Kaye reported.\n\n\"As one of the law enforcement people told me, if you can see it, they can see it,\" Orth said.\n\nMarkoff's cyber footprint was growing more clear to authorities every day. On April 20, six days after Brisman's slaying, detectives arrested him.\n\nThey said he was carrying on him a New York driver's license with a photo of someone named Andrew or Andy Miller. Police say Markoff used that driver's license to purchase the gun that killed Brisman and that his fingerprints were on the paperwork.\n\nIn June, Markoff pleaded not guilty to Brisman's death and the other charges against him. He remains in jail.\n\nCNN's Randi Kaye contributed to this report.\n\nAll About Murder and Homicide \u2022 Philip Markoff \u2022 Massachusetts"

      "source": "In one more attempt to counter music piracy, major music labels have agreed to support a service that will offer free music downloads \u0097 with some substantial restrictions \u0097 to any college student.\n\nThe service, from Ruckus Network, will be supported by advertising on its Web site and on the software used to download and play songs. The four major record labels and several independent labels have agreed to license their music to Ruckus at lower rates than they charge other mass market music services on the theory that college students would rather steal songs than pay the $10 to $15 a month that such services normally charge.\n\nPhil Leigh, president of Inside Digital Media, a research firm, said that the move also represented a way for labels to experiment with advertising-supported music, a model that he said might be better for the labels than radio, because they could share in the advertising revenue. Music publishers, which represent the composers, are paid by radio stations, but the labels, which represent performing artists, are not.\n\nRuckus had originally hoped universities would pay a fee to offer free downloads to their students, thereby reducing the legal risks and some of the network expense associated with the use of illegal file-sharing networks. Only 20 universities agreed.\n\nLast year, however, Ruckus decided to switch to a free, advertising-supported approach, although it still required universities to agree and to install a server on their campus networks.\n\nThat increased participation to about 100 schools, with \u0093several hundred thousand\u0094 active users, said Michael J. Bebel, chief executive of Ruckus.\n\nThe new service, which is available now, does not require a university to participate. Rather, it will be made available to those who have an e-mail address ending in .edu, the top-level domain associated with educational institutions.\n\nBecause faculty members and many alumni also use an .edu e-mail address, Mr. Bebel said that the service would ask users if they were students, staff members or alumni. Those who are not students will be asked to pay $8.95 a month for the service.\n\nRuckus uses Microsoft\u0092s Windows media technology, so songs can be played only on a user\u0092s personal computer. For $4.99 a month, users can buy the right to transfer the songs to portable devices compatible with the Microsoft format, including those made by SanDisk and Creative.\n\nBut the music will not play on Microsoft\u0092s Zune player or, more important, on the Apple iPod.\n\nThese restrictions have led to at least some protests on campus that the service discriminates against users of iPods and Macintosh computers (also not supported).\n\nMr. Bebel says that about 60 percent of the students on the campuses offering the Ruckus service had registered for it.\n\n\u0093Even iPod users on campus will use Ruckus because they can find music they like before they buy it from Apple or get it another way,\u0094 Mr. Bebel said."

      "source": "OVER the course of a dozen years, ever since atomic sleuths from the United Nations began scrutinizing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, hundreds of inspections have uncovered a hidden world of labs and sprawling factories, some ringed by barbed wire and antiaircraft guns, others camouflaged or buried deep underground. Yet despite that progress, Iran has so far managed to evade a central question \u2014 whether it knows how to build an atom bomb.\n\nWith negotiators from six world powers facing a deadline later this month to cut a basic agreement with Iran on the fate of its nuclear program, much of the public discussion has focused on curtailing Iran\u2019s uranium plants and plutonium complex, its pathways to atomic fuel. In short, the buzz centers on brawn, not brains. But quietly, the United States and its allies are also discussing whether a final deal should compel Tehran to reveal the depth of its atomic knowledge.\n\nThat inner debate, as one European official in the midst of the negotiations put it, turns on \u201cwhether to force Iran to explain its past\u201d \u2014 especially before 2003, when American intelligence officials believe Iran operated a full-scale equivalent of the Manhattan Project \u2014 \u201cor whether to focus on the future.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials are vague when pressed on how fully Iran will have to answer questions it has avoided for years from United Nations inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna. To date, Iran has dodged all but one of the agency\u2019s dozen sharp questions on bomb design.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s most serious verification shortcoming,\u201d Olli Heinonen, the former chief inspector, now at Harvard, said recently, \u201cremains its unwillingness to address concerns about the past and possibly ongoing military dimensions of its nuclear program.\u201d\n\nInvestigators at the I.A.E.A., drawing on intelligence from member states as well as their own investigations, have assembled a secret trove of reports, correspondence, viewgraphs, videos and blueprints that purport to show Iran\u2019s skill in warhead design.\n\nAtomic inspectors cite evidence that Iran has taken a dozen clandestine steps toward \u200ba\u200btom-bomb development. Iran denies this. It has declined to give technical replies to all but one of the specific allegations.\n\nFired electrically, detonators can initiate a nuclear blast as well as aid mining and explosive welding.

Iran is alleged to have explored building such components.\n\nThe underground test of an atom bomb requires long cables that carry high voltage to fire the sphere of detonators. Iran is alleged to have studied long-distance firing.\n\n7. FUSING, ARMING AND FIRING SYSTEM\n\nA complex system atop a missile arms and fires an atom bomb when it reaches the intended target.

Iran is alleged to have used ostensibly private companies as procurement cover.\n\n12. COVERT ACQUISITION OF BOMB FUEL\n\nThe Nonproliferation Treaty forbids secret work on the acquisition of bombs. Iran, a signatory, is alleged to have once formed undisclosed programs for making bomb fuel.\n\nIran ridicules the material as fake, maintaining that the trove is full of forged documents created by the Central Intelligence Agency or Israel\u2019s Mossad. (The atomic agency\u2019s chief, Yukiya Amano, dismissed that allegation in an interview last summer, saying the inspectors had confirmed the documents by consulting other sources.)\n\nThe problem is that the documents, if real, would undercut Iran\u2019s argument that its nuclear ambitions are entirely peaceful, centering on the production of radioisotopes for medicine and electrical power for economic growth.\n\nExpertise in warhead design, as opposed to atomic fuel production, is far more ephemeral and hard to track. It can also be less ambiguous. Some nuclear parts have application only to making weapons, such as neutron spark plugs at the core of some atom bombs. In contrast, uranium can fuel both nuclear arms and reactors that make electricity \u2014 it can light cities or annihilate them.\n\nIn early 2003, when the inspectors began their investigation, the focus was mainly on whether Iran was building factories that could make fuel for nuclear arms. That agenda made sense because acquiring fuel is the hardest part of the bomb equation. It\u2019s the chokepoint. Moreover, it was relatively easy for the inspectors to monitor the giant factories that Iran was building, such as the plutonium reactor at Arak and the uranium plant at Natanz, its halls roughly half the size of the Pentagon.\n\nToday, the six powers negotiating with Iran \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States \u2014 still focus overwhelmingly on fuel production. They want Tehran to downsize or disconnect the centrifuges that spin at supersonic speeds to purify uranium. They want the reactor at Arak, still under construction, reconfigured to produce less plutonium, the other bomb fuel. The negotiators want the cutbacks to be large enough and long enough in duration \u2014 a decade or more \u2014 to ensure that Iran for the near future cannot mount a headlong rush for a bomb, known in the field as breakout.\n\nEven Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in his dramatic speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, elevated brawn over brains, saying \u201cnuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn\u2019t get you very much.\u201d He added, \u201cA pilot without a plane can\u2019t fly.\u201d\n\nTrue enough. But there are other ways to get fuel, including buying it from the likes of North Korea or on the black market. So the design riddle still lurks in the background, both for breakout and what experts call sneak out.\n\nIran already knows how to make a rudimentary bomb. So do terrorists and college students. The real question is whether Iran can miniaturize a weapon to fit atop a missile, can make bombs more destructive than the one that turned Hiroshima into a radioactive cinder, and can use precious fuel sparingly enough to build a nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe I.A.E.A. inspectors saw hope of getting answers in mid-2007 when they agreed on a \u201cwork plan\u201d with Iran meant to shed light on what happened inside the secretive laboratories run by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, said to be Iran\u2019s atomic mastermind. More than two years later, in late 2009, the plan lay in ruins. Mohamed ElBaradei, then the agency\u2019s director general, said the inquiry had \u201ceffectively reached a dead end\u201d because of Iran\u2019s intransigence.\n\nIn November 2011, the inspectors stepped up the pressure by publishing a detailed listing of a dozen major fields critical for warhead building, saying their cache indicated that Iran had deeply researched the topics. Iran repeated its disavowal. In August 2013, as tensions mounted, Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, elected on a platform of getting international sanctions lifted, agreed to open negotiations about the overall fate of Iran\u2019s atomic program.\n\nWhile those talks have dragged on for 18 months, Iran has let inspectors deep inside its production facilities and observed every commitment on cutting back its production of nuclear fuel. But it has continued to stiff-arm the inspectors on the question of suspected \u201cmilitary dimensions,\u201d despite agreeing to another work plan. The Obama administration has said little about that silence.\n\nLast month, the inspectors reported that \u201cIran has not provided any explanations\u201d for two of the three design questions now on the table. The other nine remain in limbo.\n\nSo will Iran have to come clean before the economic sanctions are lifted? American officials won\u2019t say. \u201cIt\u2019s the most sensitive topic for the Iranians,\u201d said one former American negotiator. \u201cIs it worth blowing up a potential agreement in the name of forcing a confession?\u201d\n\nOne solution, analysts suggest, would be the gradual lifting of sanctions in step with the investigators certifying that Tehran was finally answering their longstanding queries. That is under discussion. But it remains unclear whether the atomic riddle will be resolved. If past is prologue, the West might once again find itself stonewalled.\n\nWilliam J.

Sanger is a national security correspondent for The New York Times.\n\nA version of this news analysis appears in print on March 8, 2015, on page SR4 of the New York edition with the headline: What Iran Won\u2019t Say About the Bomb.

      "source": "Not that much of the speculation about how President Obama will respond to the Democrats' likely losses in Tuesday's elections has concerned foreign affairs -- which is surprising. True, international issues -- from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the Middle East peace process -- have hardly figured in congressional campaigns across the country. Yet the conventional wisdom says the midterms' principal result will be a deadlocked Congress in which Obama's major domestic initiatives will stand little chance of passing. That means that, like more than a few presidents before him, he is likely to turn abroad in search of accomplishments to propel his reelection campaign. Bill Clinton is remembered for his domestic \"triangulations\" after the Democrats 1994 mideterm losses. But in the next two years Clinton also oversaw a major U.S. military intervention in the Balkans, brokered an interim deal between Israelis and Palestinians, signed a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia and ordered cruise missile strikes against Iraq. So what could Obama accomplish abroad between now and 2012?\n\nOne possibility will open before him later this week, when -- like Clinton before him -- he leaves the country after the election for a long tour of Asia. Obama's trip will take him to the region's big democracies -- India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea -- which in recent months have shown signs of growing nervousness about China's aggressiveness. Therein lies the opportunity: to rebuild the U.S. position as a leader and defender of Asian democracies against Beijing's belligerent autocracy. While Obama is away, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will travel to the United States for a potentially crucial meeting with Vice President Biden. The last encounter between these two last Spring led to a disastrous public dispute between Washington and Jerusalem over Israel's settlement construction in Jerusalem. But Biden actually has better rapport with Netanyahu than does Obama -- and Obama badly needs to persuade Netanyahu to make concessions on settlements that will allow the resumption of Middle East peace talks. In August, Obama pushed Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to set a one-year deadline for agreeing on the terms for a Palestinian state. In so doing, he ensured that he will begin his reelection campaign either with a historic breakthrough in the Middle East -- or a failure for which he will likely take much of the blame. Similarly, Obama has set a mid-2011 deadline for beginning troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and pledged that all American troops will leave Iraq by the end of 2011. If he is able to fulfill both those pledges without plunging either country into chaos, he will have two more big accomplishments with which to impress voters -- particularly in the Democratic base. So the next 14 months will produce plenty of presidential action on foreign policy, even if there are no sudden crises in places like Yemen or Sudan. And there is one wild card: Iran. Negotiations with its regime about its nuclear program are expected to resume later this month, but there is no indication so far that its hardline regime will be willing to stop or even to slow down its nuclear program. My colleague David Broder speculated over the weekend that Obama will lead the U.S. and its allies in a confrontation -- or even a war -- with Iran that will reshape the political landscape in 2012. I think that's unlikely. Senior administration officials appear relatively relaxed about the Iranian threat for now, in part because of technical problems Tehran has been having enriching uranium. Even if the regime remains defiant, a move toward military confrontation by either the United States or Israel before the next presidential election won't happen unless Iran itself takes radical action -- such as expelling UN inspectors. Still, foreign affairs will loom larger in the political debate by the time the next presidential campaign begins. Thanks in part to the timetables he has set, Obama will either have some big successes to talk about -- or his opponents will have some fresh clubs.\n\nBy Jackson Diehl | November 2, 2010; 12:14 PM ET Categories: Diehl | Tags: Jackson Diehl Save & Share: Previous: Midterms will determine the fate of 'don't ask, don't tell' Next: The Democrats' victim complex strikes again\n\nThat's about it, fill our his term with foreign meet and greetings stalling for time before the the next round begins after the softening up process that begins tomorrow has prepared the electoral grounds...\n\nPosted by: Wildthing1 | November 2, 2010 1:38 PM | Report abuse\n\nObama fiddles on the world stage while America remains unemployed?\n\nIs that the best an Ivy education can produce to solve America's problems?\n\nPosted by: jfv123 | November 2, 2010 2:15 PM | Report abuse\n\nSimilarly, jfv123 wrote \"is that the best an Ivy education can produce to solve America's problems?\"\n\nPosted by: jewishmother | November 2, 2010 2:29 PM | Report abuse\n\nSimilarly, jfv123 wrote \"is that the best an Ivy education can produce to solve America's problems?\"\n\nPosted by: jewishmother | November 2, 2010 2:30 PM | Report abuse\n\nDiehl, Why even pretend You fool no one.\n\nJust name the column: WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE JEWS?

      "source": "It\u2019s no surprise that there are serious problems with reporting and prosecuting campus sexual assaults.\n\nThe details of why began to emerge during the third round table convened by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) on Monday to look at the issue that is complicated by \u201ca system that is multijurisdictional,\u201d as she called it.\n\nMcCaskill, a former sex crimes prosecutor, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), talked with campus and municipal police, college administrators, victims\u2019 advocates, rape survivors (the preferred term over victim) and prosecutors to determine what should be included in legislation they propose to introduce with bipartisan support after the August recess.\n\nIn campus sexual assault cases, the problems begin with jurisdiction. Whether campus or city police investigate usually depends on where the assault took place. Once it\u2019s reported, the victim might have to be interviewed multiple times, although \u201cin a perfect world,\u201d McCaskill said that first discussion would be conducted by someone specially trained in forensic interviewing techniques.\n\nPrompt reporting was another concern in order to collect not just the physical evidence of a rape, but text messages, for example, and corroboration by witnesses.\n\nThere\u2019s also the concern that schools may discourage students from pursuing the case through the courts by emphasizing the negative consequences of seeking criminal charges, without providing information on positive results, said Jennifer Gaffney, deputy chief of the Special Victim\u2019s Bureau in the New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Gaffney noted, for example, that a college might order the accused to avoid the survivor but that the order is unenforceable when the survivor moves elsewhere after graduation, as opposed to a legal order issued through the courts.\n\nThe choice on whether to proceed in court should be left up to the survivor. \u201cSome people want public vindication through the courts,\u201d said Yale University law student Alexandra Brodsky, an organizer of Know Your IX, which aims to educate U.S. college students in about their rights under Title IX. \u201cSome people just want an extension on their English paper, or to not have to see their rapist in their dorm the following day.\u201d She said she was told by Yale not to pursue criminal charges after an attempted rape her freshman year.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s right for one survivor is not right for another survivor,\u201d pointed out Carrie Hull, a detective at the Ashland (Ore.) Police Department.\n\n\u201cReporting should be about getting services for victims,\u201d said Nancy Chi Cantalupo, research fellow at the Victim Rights Law Center and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nHull said reporting of rape cases was up 105 percent since a new program in Ashland gives survivors choices. Called \u201cYou Have Options,\u201d it allows survivors to report an assault or ask for a partial or complete investigation.\n\nProviding an advocate to survivors has been shown in research studies to improve cooperation, said Jessica Ladd-Webert, director of the Office of Victim Assistance at the University of Colorado in Boulder.\n\nConfidentiality is one of the major, if not leading, concerns of survivors. That\u2019s complicated by the requirement of the Clery Act to issue a \u201ctimely warning\u201d if students are in danger from a potential rapist.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem with timely warnings,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cYou\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHull worried that timely warnings reinforce the myth that most sexual assaults occur when someone \u201cjumps out the bushes.\u201d People \u201cdon\u2019t think it\u2019s rape if they know each other,\u201d McCaskill reiterated.\n\nYet survivors know the perpetrator in the majority of sexual assault cases, and research shows the majority of campus rapes are committed by serial offenders. What about stopping these repeat perpetrators?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never the responsibility of victims, it\u2019s the responsibility of the offender\u201d if another attack occurs, Hull said.\n\nBlumenthal asked about the issue of under-reporting, saying that \u201cenforcement gives credibility.\u201d It\u2019s the horror stories of what survivors go through that keep many of them silent. Blementhal said some schools allow the accused to question his accuser during on-campus adjudications.\n\nHe also brought up alcohol use as \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d though several agreed that the problem went beyond drinking and partying. Statutes vary from state to state on what constitutes rape and consent and the role of alcohol.\n\nThe issue of consent, though, is one that students need to understand. Darcie Folsom, director of sexual violence prevention and advocacy at Connecticut College, said she believed that\u2019s where funds should go.\n\nPrevention strategies. Learning that \u201cno means no.\u201d Trained investigators. Less paperwork and fewer regulations to wade through so campus officials can focus on the safety of their students. Options for punishment of offenders outside of the courtroom. Reasonable penalties for schools that fail to comply with the Clery Act and Title IX in providing safe campuses.\n\nThose are all needed, from what people have said during the series of round tables. But we also need a culture change, and it should start much earlier than the first week of college classes. Kathy Zoner, chief of Cornell University Police, described the cultural mindset that contributes to sexual assault:\n\n\u201cBoys will be boys and girls need to be polite.\u201d"

      "supported-summary-entities": [],
      "source": "Experiencing at least one culinary epiphany in France seems to be a rite of passage for all serious gourmands, amateurs and professionals alike. For Elizabeth David, it was a simple Gruy\u00e8re omelette at the restaurant Moli\u00e8re in Avignon. For Julia Child, it was oysters on the half shell, sole meuni\u00e8re and a green salad she ate at La Couronne in Rouen. My own acorn on the head occurred while studying abroad and culminated, after a lengthy gestation, in a cold-eyed reappraisal of a similarly humble dish: tuna salad.\n\nUpon arrival in the southern town of Aix-en-Provence as a milk-fed Midwesterner, I considered myself as prepared as any diplomat or spy for a year of international intrigue, having taken six extra summer credits of French. All was not as promised, however. For starters, whatever it was they were speaking, it had nothing whatever to do with what I had been mouthing in the language lab back home. Bewildered and humiliated, I had difficulty even parsing a restaurant menu.\n\nStaring down an entree list one afternoon on the town's bustling main drag, the Cours Mirabeau, I came across the puzzling salade compos\u00e9e. Composed salad? \"Composed of what?\" I na\u00efvely asked. The unshaven waiter raised one bored eyebrow and burped, \"N'importe quoi\" (\"Whatever\"). I ordered it anyway, and thus discovered what has since seemed to me the most perfect sleight of hand for those summer nights when no one wants to eat, much less cook: the salad as meal.\n\nBut we have dinner salads here as well; is it merely an accent that distinguishes our chef's salad or Cobb from a salade compos\u00e9e?\n\nThe term \"chef's salad\" sadly conjures blanched wisps of iceberg laden with cold cuts and sliced block cheeses, shadowed by a waxy tomato wedge or two, something that arrives from the \"diet\" side of the menu and is best left to the ladies who lunch. I'd defend a well-made Cobb to the death, with its delicious scrum of chicken, bacon, blue cheese and avocado, but it is exactly that American overkill that separates it from the concept, if not the precise definition, of a salade compos\u00e9e.\n\nAlthough that n'importe quoi, the anything-goes factor, is the defining beauty behind the salade compos\u00e9e, there is a guiding principle of restraint and balance -- typical for the French -- as well as numerous unwritten rules: there are, naturally, right ways and wrong ways to compose your composed salad. Limiting what goes in, so as to be able to taste each of the ingredients, as well as using the freshest ones possible, are obvious but often overlooked guidelines: one or two leafy summer greens, a scattering of fragrant tomatoes, some lightly poached asparagus or thin beans to start, a boiled egg if you like, a handful of black olives.\n\nCertain ingredients, I found, could alter its perception: islandy additions like fish and coconut milk create a salade tahitienne, whereas saut\u00e9ed calamari or skewered shrimp atop might garner a nautical moniker, like marini\u00e8re. The marinated chicken breast or hunk of sliced, grilled steak over watercress are the workaday versions, and I have had memorable salads topped with saut\u00e9ed gizzards or confit of duck, even torchons (\"dishrags\") of foie gras. Of course the most famous, and the only salade compos\u00e9e to have successfully traversed the Atlantic, is the ni\u00e7oise.\n\nIt was this salad (and the pan-bagnat, its sandwich counterpart) that inspired me to rethink my tuna salad. I wanted it plucky and light, a Mediterranean counterpoint to the tongue-coating thickness of our mayo-driven variations. I also wanted it dressed a bit more than the naked tuna tossed atop a ni\u00e7oise. I settled on lemon, mustard, dill and the mild, crunchy burn of Greek peppers to temper the pungency of the fish.\n\nThe crucial element to the whole enterprise however is to begin with the best solid-chunk tuna, preferably in a jar, and it absolutely has to be preserved in olive oil. I have found Italian products to be the best. Buon Italia in New York City (www.buonitalia.com) imports its own , while Flott is available in most markets. Though the ventresca, or belly meat, is considered rare and priced accordingly, I prefer the straight solid chunk meat. It is more toothsome and less fatty.\n\nIt took me only minutes to conceive my reconstructed tuna, but after years of fiddling, I still can't say that I've perfected it. Later, upon reading both Elizabeth David and the hilariously terse master Escoffier on the subject in Le Guide Culinaire (\"Tunny fish in oil, the flesh of tomatoes, diced anchovy fillets. Seasoning of tarragon, chervil and chopped chives, with or without mustard\"), I found everything I thought I had made new to be old again.\n\nI change the ingredients routinely, adding and subtracting according to whim and availability. That same breeziness becomes my undoing when incorporating it into a salade compos\u00e9e. Like any fanny-packed tourist, I will often shuffle right over the French mandate of elegant restraint and inadvertently chuck the whole larder into my delicate constructions. Beginning with the lightest touch, I'll lay on a feather's worth at a time -- some saut\u00e9ed zucchini here, those roasted red peppers; oh, and don't leave out the artichoke hearts, and absolutely those caperberries, and the ricotta salata -- until the creaking colossus threatens to bury whichever wide-eyed guests have been lured to my table.\n\nBelieve me, less in this salad is actually more. As a rule, I have found it helpful when preparing the dish to follow Coco Chanel's lead for dressing yourself: when you're finished, assess the whole in the mirror and remove one item before heading out for the day. In my case, however, it can be four or five ingredients that need escorting from the premises.\n\nThe ideal is light but fulsome, a scoop of punched-up tuna paired with the summer's best greens, some carefully considered vegetables, a soft cow or goat's milk cheese on the side with some crusty bread and a crisp, chilled ros\u00e9 to cut into it all. The goal is this: On a sweltering night, dinner must leave enough room for fresh peaches and vanilla ice cream, a fitting reward for finishing your vegetables.\n\nRos\u00e9s are closely, and appropriately, associated with the South of France and its cuisine. Tavel, a small town built on the renown of its ros\u00e9s in the midst of all the heavyweight Rh\u00f4ne reds, is arguably the most famous appellation for them, though most any competent version will enhance this summer's eve dinner. The contact with the red skins that produces the blush gives these wines a bit more body and tannin to stand up to the dense oil of the tuna. A couple of bottles that I suggest as good accompaniments are Domaine Tempier Ros\u00e9 (Bandol) and Lucien Crochet Sancerre (Loire Valley).\n\nTuna Salad 10 to 12 ounces good-quality solid tuna packed in olive oil, well drained 2 scallions washed, trimmed and chopped fine 6 pepperoncini peppers, destemmed and julienned 3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1/4 cup roasted or smoked almonds, chopped roughly, or a small handful toasted pine nuts 1/4 cup good-quality olive oil (or the oil the tuna was packed in) 1 tablespoon smooth Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or more to taste 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.\n\nMix all the ingredients well with a fork in a medium-size, nonreactive bowl. Taste and adjust the lemon juice and pepper. The salad can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated.\n\nSummer Night's Salad 6 cups summer greens (mesclun, arugula, spinach or others) 12 asparagus spears, trimmed to 3 inches, parboiled for 7 minutes, then cooled 1/4 pound haricots verts, parboiled with asparagus for 4 minutes, then cooled 6 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half 1/2 small bulb fennel, sliced very thin 6 mild pickled okra pods, sliced lengthwise into quarters 1 Kirby cucumber, sliced thin 12 or so good-quality black olives, like calamata or gaeta, pitted 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon olive oil or mustard oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 cups tuna salad (see recipe).\n\n1. Build salads to order on four large plates. Start with a small handful of greens for each plate and divide the asparagus, haricots verts, tomatoes, fennel, okra, cucumber and olives accordingly."

King Jr. is urging governors and school leaders in states that allow student paddling to end a practice he said would be considered \u201ccriminal assault or battery\u201d against an adult.\n\nKing released a letter Tuesday asking leaders to replace corporal punishment with less punitive, more supportive disciplinary practices that he said work better against bad behavior.\n\nMore than 110,000 students, including disproportionate numbers of black and disabled students, were subjected to paddling or a similar punishment in the 2013-14 school year, said King, citing the Education Department\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection.\n\nCorporal punishment is legal in 22 states.\n\n\u201cThe practice has been clearly and repeatedly linked to negative health and academic outcomes for students,\u201d King said during a conference call with reporters. \u201cIt is opposed by parent organizations, teachers unions, medical and mental health professionals and civil rights advocates as a wholly inappropriate means of school discipline.\u201d\n\nComing toward the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s term, the push to end corporal punishment builds on the administration\u2019s \u201cRethink Discipline\u201d campaign to create safe and supportive school climates, King said. It also lines up with Obama\u2019s \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative, meant to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color, he said.\n\nEighty organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, NAACP, Association of University Centers on Disabilities and American Federation of Teachers, signed an open letter released by the National Women\u2019s Law Center supporting an end to the practice. Students are regularly paddled for minor or subjective infractions like dress code violations, cellphone use or disrespecting staff, the letter said.\n\n\u201cCorporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it\u2019s time we do the same for our nation\u2019s schoolchildren,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves of the Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nAlthough its use has been diminishing, there are corners of the country where corporal punishment remains deeply woven into culture and tradition. School administrators say it has broad support from parents and preserves learning time that would be lost to a suspension.\n\nFifteen states expressly permit corporal punishment: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming. In seven states, there is no state law prohibiting it. They are: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire and South Dakota.\n\n\u201cThere are better, smarter ways to achieve safe and supportive school environment,\u201d King said, adding that the education law passed late last year supports using funding for positive intervention and supports.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has not yet announced his choice for education secretary. He met last week with Michelle Rhee, a former chancellor of the District of Columbia schools.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually matter who the secretary of education is or what people\u2019s view is about the election,\u201d AFT President Randi Weingarten said on the call with King. \u201cThis is a moral matter \u2026. We must all be about safe and welcoming places for all students.\u201d"

      "source": "On May 22, the Iraqi government announced the opening of the long-awaited battle of Fallujah, the city only 30 miles west of Baghdad that has been fully under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group\u00c2 for the past 29 months. Fallujah was a critical hub for al-Qaeda in Iraq and later ISIL in the decade before ISIL's January 2014 takeover.\n\nOn the one hand it may seem surprising that Fallujah has not been liberated sooner - after all, it has been the ISIL-controlled city closest to Baghdad for more than two years. The initial reason was that there was always something more urgent to do with Iraq's security forces.\n\nInside Story - Retaking Fallaujah\n\nIn January 2014, the Iraqi security forces were focused on preventing an ISIL takeover of Ramadi next door. The effort to retake Fallujah was judged to require detailed planning and a hasty counterattack seemed like a pointless risk.\n\nIn retrospect it may have been worth an early attempt to break up ISIL's control of the city while it was still incomplete.\n\nThen came the loss of Mosul and the battles for Haditha, Samarra, Tikrit, and Baiji. The battle to free Ramadi was fought throughout the length of the war until its recent liberation.\n\nREAD MORE:\u00c2 How to prevent sectarian backlash from Baghdad bombings\n\nThe Iraqi security forces, mainly Shia elements of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), settled into a long and inconclusive siege of Fallujah.\n\nFor the PMF, which experienced disappointing battlefield results from the spring of 2015 onwards, Fallujah became a way to give the impression that it was still a key player on the Iraqi battlefields.\n\nThis siege has caused tremendous material damage to Fallujah, which was never fully rebuilt after the great battles of 2004, when US Marines cleared the city in highly destructive block-by-block fighting.\n\nAs importantly, around 70,000 civilians out of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 350,000 original residents remain in the city out of choice or because they are too scared to try to escape.\n\nShortages of food and medicines within the Fallujah pocket have caused civilian illnesses and deaths that would be preventable under normal circumstances.\n\nThe current offensive to liberate Fallujah seems to have been driven by a combination of factors: the mass-casualty bombings in Baghdad during May, the pressure on Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to show positive results in any field, and the hiatus between the end of the battle of Ramadi and the likely start of the battle of Mosul in the late summer or autumn.\n\nShortages of food and medicines within the Fallujah pocket have caused civilian deaths and illnesses that would be preventable under normal circumstances.\n\nIn theory, there is space for a quick Fallujah operation before Iraq begins to isolate Mosul from the south and west in the autumn and then assault Mosul city itself in the winter. But will it be quick?\n\nThe much publicised beginning of the broader Mosul operation launched in March 2016 gave the impression that the city itself was close to being liberated: In fact the fighting was more than 100km from Mosul city.\n\nIn Fallujah the relieving forces are much closer - often 5-10km from the edges of the city - but the publicity surrounding the opening days of the offensive have raised expectations of an immediate entry into Fallujah a little too high.\n\nThis first week of Iraqi operations have been aimed at rolling back ISIL's control of outlying areas to the north of Fallujah at Karma, and to the east and south of the city.\n\nThe Iraqi Air Force has mounted its most intensive operations of the war to selectively strike ISIL targets in Fallujah with its US-supplied F-16 and AC-208 precision-strike aircraft, Chinese armed CH-4 drones, Russian-supplied attack helicopters and new Czech-supplied L-159 jets,\n\nThe operation clearly shows that the Iraqi government, the PMF and the coalition have learned important command-and-control lessons from previous battles.\n\nREAD MORE:\u00c2 Iraq - Are Shia leaders ready for sectarian healing?\n\nThe Iraqi government, supported by the US-led coalition, is coordinating the battle for Fallujah. They are picking the targets for aerial strikes and commanding the broad framework of the operation.\n\nThe PMF, which includes Sunni PMF from the rural areas around Fallujah, are fighting a loosely connected battle that is focused on Fallujah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rural outskirts.\n\nSome PMF elements, such as Kataib Hezbollah or Asaib Ahl al-Haq, will not receive US air support, but Iraqi aircraft will be on call to help. Importantly, Badr's leader Hadi al-Amiri said on May 24 that PMF units would not enter Fallujah city.\n\nThis division of labour is the product of lessons learned in the battles of Tikrit, Bayji and Ramadi. The PMF cannot \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo it alone\u00e2\u0080\u009d in such battles and do not achieve good results in intense urban fighting where coalition intelligence and strike capabilities are critically important.\n\nBut Iraq's security forces and the coalition have learned that the PMF are pretty good at clearing and occupying the rural zones around contested cities and preventing ISIL reinforcements from arriving, which is a necessary part of any effort to liberate a city.\n\nThe Iraqi government has learned that excluding the PMF entirely, as in Ramadi, can cause resentment. Time will tell how quickly and how effectively ISIL resistance in Fallujah will be overcome but the formula being used at Fallujah represents a positive evolution for the war in Iraq.\n\nMichael Knights is the Lafer Fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

      "source": "When Council Brandon was in fifth grade, she found herself cornered into a bathroom stall by the \u2018mean girls\u2019 of her school, who told her she wasn\u2019t pretty and needed a makeover.\n\nCouncil, 14, who lives in Hartford, Conn., said the torment didn\u2019t stop - and she ended up skipping to sixth grade in hopes the older kids would be nicer.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid to show my knowledge in school, and I was not afraid to grow as a learner \u2013 they weren\u2019t used to that,\u201d Council said of her middle school peers. \u201cAlso, I was the only (Caucasian) person in my grade, so I wasn\u2019t interested in the same music they were, or the same pop culture they were used to.\u201d\n\nCouncil\u2019s experiences are not unique, which is why she decided to become involved in \u2013 and co-host \u2013 the radio show \u201cBullied: Teen Stories From Generation PRX.\u201d\n\nThe show was created by Generation PRX and produced by WNPR, Connecticut Public Radio. A grant from the Motorola Mobility Foundation helped with funding.\n\nJake Shapiro, CEO of PRX, an online distribution marketplace for public radio programs, said when he saw the topic of bullying emerging into the media, he knew his organization was in a position to make sure these young people\u2019s voices were heard.\n\nGeneration PRX is an initiative of the company aimed at connecting youth radio with radio programs. The initiative has tackled important issues affecting young adults all over the country, such as immigration and high school dropouts.\n\n\u201cBullied\u201d is being featured on several different radio stations across the country, and it can be found streaming online here at www.prx.org\n\nA nationally conducted study found that approximately 30 percent of students are involved in bullying - as either the bully, the victim or both.\n\nHowever, bullying often goes unreported, said Jennifer Hartstein, a child and adolescent psychologist with a private practice in New York City.\n\nHartstein, who is not involved in the radio show, said in the past, bullying typically occurred at school \u2013 but with today\u2019s technology, bullying has expanded to social networks and YouTube, so students don\u2019t feel safe in their own homes.\n\n\u201cBullying occurs in a much more public forum now, promoting the conversation,\u201d Hartstein said. \u201cUnfortunately, people think that it is a \u2018rite of passage\u2019 of childhood.\u201d\n\nBullying has lead to a few highly-publicized cases of tragedy. Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old high school student from Massachusetts, committed suicide in January 2010 after enduring verbal attacks from several of her classmates. Eden Wormer, a 14-year-old student from Vancouver, Wash., killed herself Wednesday after relentless bullying.\n\nCouncil, along with her co-host, 17-year-old Peython Echelson-Russell, worked with producers to evaluate dozens of story pitches sent from teens around the country, writing the scripts, interviewing experts and telling stories.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s exciting about it is that it gives the young people a direct channel for expression around this critical topic, as opposed to being mediated through adults,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important in the mix to have a direct channel and voice \u2013 it\u2019s very powerful when done through audio in storytelling.\u201d\n\nOne of the show\u2019s vignettes was produced by Iris SanGiovanni, a 17-year-old junior at South Portland High School in Portland, Maine.\n\nIris, who regularly participates in Blunt Youth Radio, came up with the idea of \u201cPsychology of a Bully\u201d because she wondered how a bully was different from a \u2018normal\u2019 person.\n\n\u201cAt any point in our lives, we\u2019ve all been a bully \u2013 so what sets us apart from someone who does this habitually?\u201d Iris wondered.\n\nIris admitted when she was younger, she was cruel to a boy in elementary school \u2013 for no real reason \u2013 and that got her thinking: Why did she do that to him? What made her stop? She wanted to answer those questions.\n\nIris interviewed Cynthia Erdley, a professor of psychology at the University of Maine at Orono, who said bullies often act out to elevate their social status.\n\nErdley also said a bully\u2019s behavior is often reinforced \u2013 especially because bystanders don\u2019t say or do anything to stop the bad behavior.\n\n\u201cIt can even be ignoring what the bully is doing and letting it happen \u2013 that gives the bully power,\u201d Erdley said.\n\nIris also spoke to Alice, a former bully from Casco Bay High School in Maine, whose last name has been withheld for privacy reasons.\n\nIn the vignette, Alice speaks of kicking a girl out of her clique and then pulling the girl\u2019s pants down around her ankles in front of everyone.\n\nAlice explains she did this because as a newcomer to America, she had felt targeted, and she also didn\u2019t have the happiest home.\n\n\u201cMany of the outcomes of the victims are similar to those of bullies,\u201d Erdley said. \u201cBullies are not happy people; they have lower self-esteem.\u201d\n\nOther vignettes in the show include an interview with a ninth-grader whose classmates repeatedly called him \u201cOsama,\u201d a Swedish teenager who talked about her bullying issues, and an Alaskan middle schooler who looked at whether anti-bullying initiatives in schools actually work.\n\nHartstein said she believes bullies do have the ability to change their behavior \u201cin meaningful ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first step, as with all things, is being aware of the behavior, learning why you engage in it and deciding to change it,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone can learn to do this, including children and teens. It\u2019s important to get them to start examining their behaviors and learning how to be kinder and more compassionate. The earlier we can work on this, the better it will be down the road.\u201d"

      "source": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\n\nFarhad: Hello, Mike. I\u2019m not including an exclamation mark there because this is my first week back from vacation in Hawaii, and I\u2019m not that excited about being here. Sorry.\n\nMike: After visiting Hawaii for the first time in my life this year, I fully understand. Mahalo.\n\nFarhad: So let\u2019s get to the news of the week. Facebook announced its earnings and crushed all expectations; the company keeps getting more users, and it keeps making more money from advertising to each user, than many on Wall Street dreamed possible.\n\nMike: Remember back when Facebook went public and no one thought it could make any money? I barely do, and it seems as if it\u2019s now a distant memory for almost everyone else too, since the company is worth like infinity dollars.\n\nFarhad: Yeah. Amazon, which has been stung by The New York Times\u2019s reporting on its hard-charging corporate culture, added some new perks for its workers. It also opened a physical bookstore in Seattle, an odd move that may signal a new direction for the company (or may not),\n\nFortune reported that Jet.com, a start-up that aimed to compete directly with Amazon, was close to raising around $500 million from investors; according to The Wall Street Journal, though, the company needed the financing desperately because it risked running out of money by the end of the year. Competing with Amazon isn\u2019t easy, as pretty much everyone predicted.\n\nOh, also, Twitter changed the Favorite \u2014 a star-shape button that would let you express some vague response to a tweet \u2014 into a heart-shape button called a Like. I think this change is awful. Twitter\u2019s favorites, as I\u2019ve argued before, are wondrous precisely because they\u2019re vague. They\u2019re an example of what I call digital body language.\n\nYou\u2019re not as troubled by the change, but because hardly anyone uses Twitter anyway, I don\u2019t think we should spend much time arguing about it.\n\nMike: I would interrupt you to reinforce the point that I am right and you are wrong, but I think anyone reading this newsletter sort of assumes that anyway.\n\nFarhad: Don\u2019t start, Mike. Instead, let\u2019s talk about San Francisco voters\u2019 rejection of Prop F, a measure that would have imposed substantial restrictions on Airbnb rentals in the city. The short-term rental start-up spent a lot of money fighting this measure, and it won big. The win was surprising because if you follow the local news, it seems pretty clear that San Franciscans hate techies. So how did Airbnb win this?\n\nMike: Airbnb is smart, and this is not its first rodeo in dealing with regulators on a local level.\n\nLook at its historical game plan: It\u2019s sort of an \u201cask forgiveness, not permission\u201d approach to moving into cities. Airbnb starts up widely in an area \u2014 San Francisco, for instance \u2014 and gets to a large enough scale that renting out one\u2019s home starts to become a normal thing. Perhaps people even support it publicly, or at least rave about it to their friends.\n\nThat\u2019s just the beginning. Years, or in some cases months later, regulators pick up on the fact that hey, a lot of folks are doing this. And there\u2019s no tax structure or really zoning rules around any of it. We should probably do something.\n\nSo things come along like Prop F which, to a great degree, was backed by local tenants\u2019 unions and folks who claim that Airbnb is raising housing prices around San Francisco to an absurd degree. (The median monthly rent in San Francisco is nearing 3,500 bucks, or like, one-twentieth of a Tesla.)\n\nAnyway, by this time enough people use Airbnb so that the company can mobilize its user base with a bunch of campaigns and direct email marketing to rally folks against Prop F, which they did quite effectively. Prop F failed, and some say that was largely brought about by the mail-in vote. My guess was those were folks directly targeted by Airbnb\u2019s anti-Prop F digital campaigns.\n\nWhat is the lesson here? There will be a lot more of this type of thing from this type of company. Just look at Uber, which seems to have perfected the art of bum-rushing cities, then becoming a much-loved necessity to the population.\n\nFarhad: Of course, this behavior is not really preferred. It would be nice if tech companies asked permission first, worked with regulators to cut through all the red tape, and only then started operating in an area. But does anyone really think that would work?\n\nUnusual new ideas tend to induce immediate skepticism. Just about everyone who first heard of the app that lets you rent strangers\u2019 bedrooms or get random drivers to ferry you around the city thought they were laughably unworkable, dangerous or worse. Regulators, who tend to be cautious and conservative, and who are sometimes in the pocket of incumbent industries (hotels, taxi coalitions), are especially unlikely to look favorably upon bold tech ideas that are merely in the prototype state.\n\nMike: Holy moley, you sound like a venture capitalist. But go on.\n\nFarhad: Given this climate, start-ups often have no other option but to barge in and cultivate a loyal customer base that can then press for favorable rules on their behalf. This works especially well when the start-ups are marketplaces \u2014 that is, when they have sellers and buyers, like Uber\u2019s drivers and riders, or Airbnb\u2019s hosts and renters. These companies can often present solid evidence that real people would be harmed financially if the start-ups were forced to shut down \u2014 which is exactly what Airbnb did here and what Uber did in New York this year.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a messy process. But in the long run it works \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a way around it if we don\u2019t want to shut out any innovation in these markets.\n\nArgh, I really sound like I live in Silicon Valley, right?\n\nMike: Basically I\u2019m waiting for you to start your own firm. Farhad Capital has a nice ring to it.\n\nSo I agree with you, insofar as it takes aggression and sometimes plunging headlong into an industry to overcome natural monopolies, and Uber and Airbnb sure have done that. But does that apply to all companies in every sector? Theranos, for instance, is dealing with people\u2019s lives. Is it cool to be \u201cdisruptive\u201d in that case?\n\nAhem, booyah. That was one good point I just made. And I think I got the last word until next week!\n\nFarhad: O.K., you get the last word for now. But don\u2019t come looking for funding from Farhad Capital. See you!"

That's suggests downside momentum is building; another ominous sign.\n\nAll told, Ponsi interprets these patterns to mean that the decline in Amazon is far from over. The patterns suggest to him that Amazon's decline could continue down to its next major floor of support, which is $280.\n\nCramer thinks the analysis makes sense. Amazon is a company that trades at a significant premium and though it shows tremendous growth it doesn't generate significant profits. These are the kinds of stocks that pros are selling as part of a broad rotation underway in the market. In other words pros are rotating out of Amazon and technical analysis suggests the rotation isn't done.\n\nConversely, patterns in IBM appear very bullish.\n\nPonsi's analysis shows that IBM's 50-day moving average is crossing above the 200-day; that's a bullish pattern.\n\nAlso, IBM is very close to breaking through its major ceiling of resistance at $195, which has been putting a cap on the stock since September. If IBM breaks out above $195, Ponsi believes the stock could trade up to last year's high of $215. And any move past $215 would take IBM to new all-time highs, which means there's no further resistance beyond that level.\n\nCramer thinks the IBM analysis makes sense, too. Pros are rotating into value stocks such as IBM that could generate significantly higher profits if the economy improves. The technical analysis seems to confirm the thesis.\n\nRead more from Mad Money with Jim CramerCramer goes behind Nasdaq selloffCramer's cheap $1000 stockInsider insights: Cramer goes behind the solar story\n\nIf you're a sophisticated investor, Ponsi thinks the timing may be right for a pairs trade; that is establishing a long position in a stock you think will go higher and then shorting it against a stock you think will go lower. From the analysis outlined above, Ed Ponsi would suggest long IBM against short Amazon.\n\n\"Based on my remembrances of rotations past, I think Ponsi's probably right about IBM,\" said Cramer, \"Amazon, however, has nine lives and I'm not sure we've seen them all just yet.\""

      "source": "North of the Arctic Circle, a top priority for fishermen is to catch and dry enough char to last the winter. Fishermen near the equator race to market before insects and bacteria spoil their catch. Climate is the driving factor shaping these vastly different fishing practices. In many corporations, the same is true for marketing and IT departments.\n\nPreviously, marketing and IT departments worked independently of one another. However, the digital revolution has forced these departments to become so interdependent that CMOs and CTOs are practically in the same line of work. From retail to Web to mobile, marketing is responsible for how brand strategy affects technical infrastructure, and IT is on the hook for how technology decisions alter brand experience.\n\nWhile both kinds of executives share high-level goals, their priorities differ. Marketers find flexibility and agility most important, while IT execs value stability and continuity. For decades, this difference was insignificant because, like arctic and equatorial fishermen, both groups worked half a world apart. Now, marketing and IT leaders are in the same boat, forced to work hand-in-hand on a wide range of digital strategies and tactics.\n\nUnfortunately, that boat is rocking. More than 20% of marketing executives describe the relationship between marketing and IT as \"poor\" or \"very poor,\" according to a survey by Forrester Research. In the same survey, not a single marketing or IT exec described the relationship as \"very strong.\" Top frustrations from marketers include delays in getting to market and speed in completing projects; rigid processes and aversion or inability to change; low prioritization of marketing projects; and language and communication barriers. IT frustrations include unrealistic deadlines; lack of lead time; frequency of changes; a need for clear prioritization by marketing; and failure to involve IT early in strategic discussions.\n\nThe solution is climate control. Differences in budgeting (operating and capital), goal setting (defensive and offensive inclinations), and success metrics (reciprocal campaign success targets) create a fractured relationship between IT and marketing departments. Climate control adjusts this relationship, allowing organizations to heal themselves without expensive coping strategies and extra layers of management.\n\nHere are four simple steps that CEOs can take to control climate.\n\n1. Allow IT to experiment. Chief executives need to tolerate small IT mistakes. Downtime is expensive, but so is uptime if it prevents companies from taking reasonable risks. ThomsonReuters understands this tradeoff well. It operates a 23-story outdoor digital display in the heart of Times Square and encourages its IT team to innovate and experiment. The team routinely integrates cutting-edge mobile, social, wireless and gesture-recognition technologies into live campaigns on the digital sign (not just demos and prototypes). A decade after the digital out-of-home platform launched, ThomsonReuters' technology is redrawing branding boundaries, and its installation is still the most advanced in the world.\n\n2. Give IT a stake in marketing. Nike routinely leverages the power of programmer creativity. Branding technology developed by interactive agency R/GA is the foundation for Kicks Creator, a digital brand experience that invites people to create their own Nike Dunks by mixing patterns, graphics and color combos. A partnership between R/GA programmers, Nike IT and Michael Tchao of Nike's \"Tech Lab\" sparked the digital running platform Nike+. These tech-driven platforms are marketing channels for the Nike brand. However, they wouldn't exist without programming insight.\n\n3. Let marketers tinker with technology. Chief executives should give marketers the chance to experiment with and select technologies. The key to ROI is finding the duds as quickly and inexpensively as possible. Fortunately, there are lots of ways that marketers can experiment without risking valuable corporate networks, data and infrastructure. Low-cost platforms like Amazon S3, Google App Engine, Google Maps and YouTube, plus a host of inexpensive hosted LAMP offerings, make it possible to quickly build scalable, secure applications and test key assumptions without breaking the bank.\n\n4. Mix things up. Systems work better when IT and Marketing work in the same room and share responsibility for uptime. Nike understands this well, and it's the reason many senior developers and technical architects report into the marketing organization. Other companies, like oil and gas services company Baker Hughes and resort operator Gaylord Entertainment, went a step further and combined CTO and CMO roles to make sure marketing objectives are met without sacrificing technical performance.\n\nThe digital revolution is blurring the line between IT and marketing. Smart brands realize climate control is the key to creating a single integrated digital branding team. Like fishermen from different parts of the world meeting for a tournament, IT and its marketing counterparts can adjust and adapt to a unified environment if given the chance.\n\nJohn Mayo-Smith is the EVP, chief technology officer of interactive agency R/GA. In this role, he manages R/GA's technology department, which comprises approximately 20% of R/GA's staff in New York and London. John earned a B.A. from Franklin & Marshall College and an MBA from Columbia Business School."

      "source": "\u0093Set in Stone: The Face in Medieval Sculpture\u0094 is one of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels. The show brings together similar objects that are not so much little seen as little noticed, and proceeds to make you notice them, big time. It touches on history, connoisseurship, artistic discovery and the latest attributions and research techniques, the latter involving the geochemical matching of limestone isotopes. And the primary vehicle for this excursion is that most profoundly familiar yet persistently engaging motif, the human face.\n\n\u0093Set in Stone: The Face in Medieval Sculpture\u0094 is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, through Feb. 19; (212) 535-7710.\n\nThe world glimpsed in this show is Europe in the 12th, 13th and early 14th centuries, when the Romanesque style was giving way to Gothic, as reflected in about 70 heads and related objects, in carved stone, wood and metal. These have been assembled by Charles T. Little and Wendy A. Stein, who are, respectively, curator and research associate in the Met\u0092s department of medieval art and the Cloisters. Mr. Little has also edited the show\u0092s excellent catalog.\n\nSome of the heads are portrait busts; others are tomb effigies or reliquaries, including an astounding reliquary bust of St. Yrieix in bejeweled silver and gold and its humbler but more expressive walnut core. But the majority are immensely appealing, somewhat battered orphans in white limestone: heads that were lopped off stone figures and reliefs that cover facades or interiors of European cathedrals and abbey churches. Depicting everything from Old Testament kings and prophets and angels, saints and apostles, to actual kings and clerics as well as devils and grotesques, these carvings turned churches into Bibles in stone.\n\nThey were sometimes removed when tastes changed, but were more often the victims of iconoclasm during protracted struggles like the Hundred Years\u0092 War, the Thirty Years\u0092 War, the Protestant and English Reformations and the French Revolution. Most of the heads are missing a feature or two or three, usually starting with the nose. Two noseless apostles with customary flowing hair and beards from around 1230 once adorned the Cathedral of Th\u00e9rouanne, a city on the shifting border between France and Flanders that the Flemish razed in 1553.\n\nThe medieval sculpture specialist Willibald Sauerl\u00e4nder writes in the catalog that while the pejorative term Dark Ages is usually avoided these days, the Middle Ages were genuinely dark in many respects. In sculpture the skills of the Greeks and Romans had been forgotten; the church was not interested in human likenesses or ideal bodies or much of anything to do with the flesh.\n\n\u0093The visible image represents an invisible truth,\u0094 a religious church text around 1000 directed, and those truths were generally of two kinds: good and evil. The sculptor\u0092s job was to illuminate the difference for a largely illiterate populace, bearing in mind that evil was subhuman, and that spirituality was not to be sullied by overt expressions of emotion or suffering.\n\nThe core of the show is formed by nearly 40 limestone heads made in France during the 12 and 13th centuries, when Paris enjoyed its first heyday as an art center. The Gothic style emerged there and in other north-central cities and religious centers like Saint-Denis, Reims, Amiens and Chartres. Heads from these locations show most clearly the tug of war between the dictums of the church and the rising interest in naturalism. They often seemed to fight to a draw, resulting in a certain sameness of expression \u0097 solemn dignity \u0097 among the kings and apostles and an almost bland purity exuded by sculptures of Jesus.\n\nAt times most of the formal and psychic energy seem relegated to the periphery, into hair and beards, which are described in a fascinating array of parallel strands, snail curls, dangling spirals and S-curves. The hirsute reaches a kind of zenith of sculptural expressivity in two powerful German pieces, an Upper Rhineland head of an apostle in distinctive red sandstone from the late 13th century and, from early-14th-century Munich, a superb sculpture depicting the head of St. John the Baptist, decapitated but alert, looking heavenward, resting in a large dish as Salome requested."

      "source": "Why must China either \"rule the world\" or \"collapse\"? For one, sensationalizing extremes sells books. In his review of my book,How China's Leaders Think, Gordon Chang, he of the \"collapse\" persuasion, defends his self-claimed turf. But with China playing an increasingly central role in world economics and politics, it is vital to know how China's leaders think, not what Chang thinks they think--or, if he likes, what China's leaders say, not what Chang says they say. If Chang would listen more patiently, he might be wrong less frequently.\n\nChang ridicules the political slogans of Chinese leaders, calling President Hu Jintao's \"Scientific Perspective on Development\" \"meaningless.\" Obviously Chang has not spoken to China's officials across the country, whose jobs and careers are judged on how well they implement this \"meaningless\" policy (e.g., GDP growth per units of energy).\n\nChang offers one-sided conventional wisdom about China. When he wrote (circa 2000) that nonperforming loans of China's major banks would undermine the financial system and the Chinese economy would collapse, he was repeating what many thought likely. Today the market capitalizations of China's major banks are among the largest in the world. I tell the long story in my book, but Chang, whose prophecy failed, ignores it.\n\nOf course, China has problems, serious ones. In How China's Leaders Think, I deal with economic and social imbalances, pollution, unsustainable development, corruption, migrant workers, unemployment and crime. I explore human rights, censorship, religious freedom, ethnic clashes and international conflicts. What I provide is perspective from China's leaders. I report what they tell me about their problems--in extended conversations, not selected sound bites. Chang does not mention any of this; in his courtroom, apparently, the only facts admissible are those that conform to his \"collapse\" theories.\n\nFurthermore, to know China is to meet a diverse spectrum of China's leaders, not just senior political figures (current and future)--leaders in the private sector, state-owned enterprises, banking, foreign affairs, military, health care, religion, media, film, literature, ideology and more. These are the people forming new thought and driving further reform.\n\nGordon Chang believes, as do most Westerners, that China's problems are caused almost entirely by one-party rule. I disagree, but the issue is legitimately contentious and vital for China, and the battle should be joined. I contend that, at least for now, one party rule is optimum for China, with its massive population, rapid transformation, uneven development and huge disparities. I assert, however, that political monopoly requires that the ruling party fulfill a higher obligation: not only to raise standards of living but also to promote transparency and public participation in governance, rule of law and human rights. China's kind of democracy does not embed the Western ideal of one person, one vote, rather it seeks innovative political mechanisms to achieve similar personal and social benefits (e.g., citizen input in the appointment process of some officials; Internet outrage against miscarriages of justice). China's kind of democracy is fledgling and fragile, a work in progress, and not every step is forward. But the Chinese people, in general and at least for now, support it, voicing higher satisfaction with their government than do Westerners (especially Americans).\n\nDo I support one-party rule presently in China? Yes, I do. So, Gordon, here's my challenge: Debate me. The resolution is one-party rule in China. You'll start with almost everyone on your side. We can debate other China issues, too. The more China is discussed, the more aware we all become. Counselor, choose your medium! Name your forum!\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn, an international investment banker and corporate strategist, is a longtime adviser to the Chinese government.

Foxconn, the company that manufactures devices for Apple, Sony, Nintendo and HP, moved here to be closer to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Cargo volume in and out of Zhengzhou grew by 80 percent in 2014, compared to just 4 percent on average in China.\n\nWhile Zhengzhou is a provincial capital located inland in the Henan Province, the airport is set up as a special economic zone designed to cater to aerial logistics. More than 20,000 workers today are building a second terminal and runway; by 2030, five runways are expected to handle 5 million tons of cargo and 70 million passengers a year. By 2025, the surrounding population is expected to hit 2.6 million, double what it is today. There has been speculation that Foxconn may one day launch its own cargo airline out of Guangzhou Baiyun, given its gargantuan shipping demands.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s 20 busiest international cargo hubs, Dubai World Central, which covers almost 56 square miles with a planned capacity for 220 million passengers, has spawned a self-sustaining economic zone with districts customized for residences, commercial space, aviation, exhibition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even golf.\n\nThe airport itself sits adjacent to the Jebel Ali port and trade zone, the world\u2019s largest manmade harbor, which supports massive manufacturing and provides tariff advantages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause of its shipping position and low-cost, high-speed logistics, Dubai makes it possible to send shipments from China via ocean freight and move it onto planes to Africa,\u201d Lindsay says.\n\nDWC is also designed as an integrated, customs-bonded warehouse zone: Shippers can move cargo in a matter of hours. Last year, DWC\u2019s Al Maktoum International began a $32 billion expansion to bring its annual cargo capacity to 16 million tons per year. \u201cDubai is seen by Chinese firms in particular as the most important place to be,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cIt\u2019s a hub for northern and sub-Saharan Africa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith the help of Copa Airlines and the $5.2 billion Panama Canal expansion, another aerotropolis is springing up around Tocumen, Central America\u2019s busiest airport.\n\nAerotropolises are becoming hubs for not only air transportation, but for ocean and ground transportation as well.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c[Copa] is very aggressive in bidding to become the Dubai of the Americas,\u201d Lindsay says. The so-called \u201cPanatropolis\u201d is only a two-hour flight from Miami, eight hours from Europe, and five and half from Rio de Janeiro. Since it\u2019s impossible with current aircraft to fly directly from northeastern Asia to the Southern Hemisphere, Panama will likely emerge as the hub for sending commodities out of South America to China in exchange for finished goods.\n\n\u201cAerotropolises are becoming hubs for not only air transportation, but for ocean and ground transportation as well,\u201d says Brian Littlefield, UPS marketing director for the aerospace segment. \u201cCompanies take advantage of these hubs by locating manufacturing and distribution near them to obtain inbound materials and provide finished goods to end customers faster and more efficiently.\u201d\n\nThe planned project in Tocumen calls for four phases of development in 40 years\u2019 time. It includes a Tocumen Airport City, which would house everything from trade and exhibition facilities to hotels, shopping, mixed-use commercial space, and residential areas with green space. Panama also boasts a new $1.7 billion subway and oceanfront highway. Lastly, its economy has grown 8 percent in the last five years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 double that of its neighboring countries.\n\nAs increasingly critical links in the global supply chain, these emerging logistics hubs will continue to influence the global economy for years to come. For companies around the world, the challenge is tapping that influence to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal news organization was not involved in the creation of this content."

Chris Christie spoke Tuesday night to a crowd of about a thousand people at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. The topic of his speech was leadership, but it was not what he said that distinguished the night; it was the audience's overt, emotional desire for him to enter the presidential race. \u2026 We could see one element of the governor's appeal: He takes complex intellectual arguments and transforms them into language everyone can grasp. They see his depth, and his ability to communicate persuasively. That, and he is the comfortable unmade bed to candidate Mitt Romney's hospital corners. While Christie did not announce a presidential run, he also never said he would not.\"\n\nBy Jae C. Hong, AP\n\nWanted: Supporters clamor for GOP New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to run for president.\n\nBy Jae C. Hong, AP\n\nWanted: Supporters clamor for GOP New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to run for president.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes a variety of opinions from outside writers. On political and policy matters, we publish opinions from across the political spectrum.\n\nRoughly half of our columns come from our Board of Contributors, a group whose interests range from education to religion to sports to the economy. Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories, large and small, that collectively make us what we are.\n\nWe also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth, USA TODAY's founder, and DeWayne Wickham, who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well. That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by well-known and lesser-known names alike.\n\nMichael Tomasky on The Daily Beast: \"Christie has supported the assault-weapons ban and opposed conceal-carry laws. He says global warming is real and calls evidence of the harmful effects of carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 in other words, acknowledgement of a human role \u2014 'undeniable.' \u2026 So Christie possesses a record capable of breaking right-wing hearts more ways than (Rick) Perry can. The one thing Christie has going for him is (that) \u2026 rage and resentment ooze out of him. \u2026 Good as Christie was (in his speech), the whole package is more problematic for conservatives and reminds us that there is no perfect conservative candidate.\"\n\nJamal Simmons on The Huffington Post: \"Even if Christie can magically conquer all of the logistical complications of a presidential campaign, then he needs to master the metaphysics. Does he have a feel for what the country wants and how to convince them he is the man to give it to them? Until recently, Christie has been sticking fairly close to New Jersey. Undoubtedly he has a strong feel for the people of the Garden State, but those in Iowa or South Carolina might see the world just a bit differently. \u2026 A man can't really be talked into running for president and do it well. The successful ones tend to have a drive to get to the White House that makes the early mornings, late nights, absence from family events and other grueling tasks of a campaign more appealing than all of the other more reasonable options.\"\n\nAri Fleischer on CNN Opinion: \"I'm a Christie fan. He's refreshing, he's raw, he takes on the big challenges, especially fiscal ones, and he's a Republican governor in a blue state, a helpful fact for a presidential candidate. But he's also late \u2014 too late to successfully mount a winning campaign for the Republican nomination. \u2026 Let's say he declares his candidacy this weekend\u2026 a mere four-and-a-half months before the New Hampshire primary, a contest where a Northeastern governor like Christie has to win or come in a close second if his candidacy is to have a chance. He and his supporters will immediately be hit by the cold, harsh slap of political reality, and they will realize there aren't enough hours in the day to accomplish what they need.\"\n\nJason Raznick on Forbes.com: \"If Christie ran for the Republican nomination this year, he would probably win, and could potentially win the presidency, as Wall Street and the Republican(s) \u2026 see him as a stronger leader than either Perry or Romney, the two leading candidates. \u2026 Christie knows that he still has massive amounts of work to do in New Jersey, and governors who have had multiple terms in their states have gone on to have two-term presidencies. A second term for Christie would provide him with additional experience on running New Jersey, and better prepare him for a potential run at president.\"\n\n, visit our FAQ's.

      "source": "Dillinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is an industrial-chic local restaurant that opened on a site vacated by a Michelin-starred eatery. (Dillinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s)\n\nNow that Ireland\u2019s Celtic Tiger -- the name given to the Irish economy as it transitioned from one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the richest -- is more of a kitten, some would have thought Dublin\u2019s restaurant scene would have followed suit. But, while the economy may have cooled, the capital\u2019s kitchens are heating up. Thanks to a combination of falling rents and customers\u2019 tightened purse strings, a wave of youthful and well-travelled restaurateurs have moved in, bucking the trend of overblown excess and opening smaller establishments with a decidedly more personal feel.\n\nOne of the first to open was Coppinger Row, tucked down a side street that skirts the edge of the stately Powerscourt Townhouse Centre just off Grafton Street, the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare. Coppinger Row\u2019s winning formula is a buzzy, informal atmosphere and a menu that sticks to a vaguely Mediterranean slant. Try the garlic and chilli prawns cooked a la plancha (grilled on a metal plate).\n\nA few streets away, 777 is the city\u2019s first upscale Mexican joint, a far cry from the Tex-Mex that normally counts as authentic in the Irish capital. Its owner John Farrell has proved himself an expert at appealing to post-boom diners with his first success, Dillinger\u2019s, an industrial-chic local restaurant that opened on a site vacated by a Michelin-starred eatery. With a long, communal table and a killer list of tequilas and cocktails served alongside sophisticated renditions of Mexican staples, 777 is styled alone the lines of a Latino speakeasy (similar to New York\u2019s La Esquina or London\u2019s Bodega Negra). A tiled wall depicts a couple in a sultry embrace. Ceviche, tuna tostadas and taquitos, plus various meat and fish dishes cooked over a wood-burning grill, are presented on beautifully decorated places and enamel bowls.\n\nTwo doors down, San Lorenzo\u2019s is another new arrival run by two veterans of Dublin\u2019s dining scene, Temple Garner and Gerry Crossan (they ran the closed but much-loved Mermaid Caf\u00e9 and boom-time favourite, Town Bar and Grill). Tiffany-style pendant lights lend the only flash of colour in an otherwise monochrome and sparsely decorated room. Its hearty, Italian-inspired dishes, such as char-grilled squid with borlotti beans, change on a daily basis.\n\nRestaurateur Joe Macken\u2019s establishments, which offer thrifty, quality food in hip surroundings, have also proved successful with recession-conscious diners. His previous venture, Crackbird, serves just one thing -- an upmarket twist on fried chicken accompanied by a choice of homemade sauces. His most recent venture, Bear, champions less-fashionable cuts of meat, like Argentine-inspired rosary cut ribs and flank steaks char-grilled over an open flame.\n\nSomething of a diners\u2019 crossroads has sprung up a short distance from the city centre in the shadow of Aviva Stadium, with diminutive Juniors being one of the first to take up residence. The New York-style deli (though not a part of the New York City-based chain) was conceived by two brothers, one an ex stockbroker and the other a chef. It morphs into an Italian-inspired cafe by night, serving crowd-pleasing plates of spaghetti alla vongole (with clams), pints of prawns and heartier dishes like roast rump of lamb. There are just a handful of tables facing a small open kitchen, while hardier souls wrap themselves in complimentary blankets to brave the outside chill.\n\nIn 2010 the same duo opened Paulie\u2019s Pizza just around the corner from Juniors. Taking its cue from the age-old Neapolitan tradition, pizzas are made from slowly proofed sourdough, San Marzano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella singed in an extremely hot wood-fired oven.\n\nAcross the road, the Chophouse is a large-windowed gastro pub that serves a menu of comfort food classics like fish and chips, and an exemplary Charolais Rib Eye steak, which has been dry-aged for 32 days."

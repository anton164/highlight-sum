The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.\nYou need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.\nUntil your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a \"holding\" or \"come back later\" message. You can copy and paste this:\nStudents from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.\nHave a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.\nOnce the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.\nAs soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.\nAs soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!\nOnce live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.\nNo. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.\nAlso, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.\nYes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.\nRemember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.\nIf you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!\nYou could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nYou could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.\nIf you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.\nThe golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.\nRefer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.\nBe aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.\nAt the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.\nIt is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.\nIt is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.\nOur agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.\nFor this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nProviding the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.\nGenerally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.\nIf your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.\nA dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.\nRight click the images, and select Save Picture As."

A goal is an occasion.\"\nWe thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that.\nThere is a long way to go though.\nThe technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in.\nIn a test on five matches, the technology detected 70 per cent of the total goals.\n\"We need to be sincere,\" says Arnau. \"We need to say that at the moment it's not possible to perform a complete automatic summary just yet. It's difficult to detect all the goals.\"\n\"However, we think it's very easy to discard those moments that are not important. For example, the panoramic views. They are easy to detect and to discard them so that already makes the job of the editor easier.\"\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube"

How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.\n\"We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: \"Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.\n\"The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.\"\nBBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the \"Treasury shredding machine\" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.\nIn a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said \"we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament\".\nKamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.\nNevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and \"fix the finances\".\nMr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.\nBut there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.\nEven before the referendum vote he only had \"a slightly better than 50/50 chance\" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nBut the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.\n\"Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,\" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.\nIt is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people \"it's the economy, stupid\" still holds true.\nFor the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's \"fiscal rule\" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.\n\"While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,\" Mrs May said.\nNow the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be \"realistic\" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.\nMy Treasury sources point out that the \"rule\" can be varied in \"non-normal\" times.\nAnd these are pretty \"non-normal\" times.\nThe abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.\nMore from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity\nThe Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.\nIn a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.\nThe BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.\nSources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can \"unite\" around Home Secretary Theresa May.\nMr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.\nIn a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by \"conviction\" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.\nThree other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.\nThe government borrowed \u00c2\u00a374.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached \u00c2\u00a317.9bn, \u00c2\u00a30.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.\nIt is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.\n\"The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,\"said Paul Johnson from the IFS.\n\"So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.\""

And if the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wins he would also claim endorsement for placing his own political priorities at the centre of the talks to come.\nBut in European terms, that's something of a secondary issue.\nThe EU Commission's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, is going to have to deal with whoever is in residence in 10 Downing Street and the strength of the occupant's mandate won't be his concern.\nHis team have already said that while the announcement doesn't change anything, there's a hope that it will produce a strong leader with strong backing from the people of the UK.\nAnd we can be sure this British election will be watched with even closer attention than usual - not just in Brussels but in the other European capitals where Brexit is going to be a huge issue in the years to come.\nFirst, both Theresa May and all her rivals will have to set out their visions for Brexit in much more detail than we've heard so far.\nBritish voters will demand nothing less.\nBut in the process, the Barnier team and the governments of France, Germany and the rest will get a feeling for where the British red lines in negotiations really lie.\nAny British candidate worth his or her salt will try to leave room for manoeuvre in the talks to come after the election, but it will surely be impossible to campaign without giving away at least some detail.\nAnd of course there are romantics across Europe who hope that the voice of the Remainers will be heard loud and clear in the British debate to come.\nThe hope that Brexit might be quickly reversed has pretty much faded from the European debate now, but plenty of politicians across the continent will be hoping to hear candidates putting forward the argument for a soft Brexit with the closest possible links to the EU and its single market.\nThat may be wishful thinking, but there'll be strong support for such voices from many quarters in Europe.\nEurope was taken by surprise by Theresa May's announcement, but not taken aback. The EU negotiators have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare their position and their message is that they're ready to negotiate with Britain, no matter who occupies 10 Downing Street.\nThis was already a busy year for European democracy - the Netherlands has already voted, while France votes for a president at the weekend and will hold National Assembly elections in June.\nGermany goes to the polls in September.\nBut there's an awareness that the UK election will be different precisely because it will play a huge part in shaping the British negotiating position on Brexit.\nAnd, of course, there's also the fascination of the pure political theatre of it all."

That meant 2bn euros of tax rises and spending cuts planned for next year would no longer be needed to reach the EU limit of 3% by the end of 2015, he said.\nThe economic improvement comes after years of austerity, a bailout from international lenders, and relentless austerity measures.\n\"At face value, the numbers suggest that the boom is back,\" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland.\n\"It shows a clearly improving economy.

      "source": "They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.\nPolice officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was \"obviously not well\".\nLanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.\n\"Camera shy\" was the comment by his entry.\nUnlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.\nAdam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.\nHe went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.\nHis aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was \"definitely the challenge to the family in that house\".\n\"Every family has one. I have one. They have one. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,\" she said.\nIntelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.\nRichard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had \"some disabilities\".\nHe was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to \"take flight\", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.\n\"You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.\"\nMr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.\n\"If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,\" he said.\nAn inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.\nThey stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.\nOlivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was \"very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody\".\n\"Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,\" she said.\nA former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.\n\"You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,\" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.\nMarsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.\nThe parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.\nHis mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.\nFriends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was \"a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.\"\nContrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nShe was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.\nAdam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.\nIn a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: \"No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.\n\"We, too, are asking why. Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.\""

The Conference bent over backwards to help them.\n\"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.\n\"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.\n\"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier.

      "source": "His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\""

Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon.\n\"I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further.\n\"And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.\"\nWhat are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nMs Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning.\nShe said: \"People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots.\n\"And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.\"\nThe SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in.\nIn response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum.\nIn Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits.\nMr Murphy said: \"The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a \u00a37.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it.\n\"Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity.\n\"Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: \"Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.\"\nVoters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.\nPolling suggests the contest will be tight and no one party will win an overall majority in the House of Commons."

      "source": "Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease.\nThe new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko.\nThe reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ.\nThe skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.\nIn addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.\nAlthough several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.\nThey can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.\nBut Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.\n\"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar,\" said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\nThe new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar."

      "source": "When Google paid $3.2bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector.\nIt got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone.\nNow, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later.\nTellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview.\n\"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says.\n\"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it.\n\"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\"\nWhen Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things\", which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products.\nBut in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties.\n\"It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'\" Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\"\n\"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\"\nThe $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a3965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house.\nThat was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products.\nMoreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed.\nBut Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software.\n\"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says.\n\"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do.\n\"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms.\n\"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\"\nFor now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up.\nIt is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam.\nThe motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud.\nIf you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive.\nBut the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired.\nThat means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google.\nBearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can\", it raises the question: what's taking so long?\n\"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling.\n\"I would love to have more, faster.\n\"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\"\nHe adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide.\nBut such advances have less impact than a new product.\n\"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says.\n\"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal.\n\"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\"\nThe two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements.\nWith the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused.\nJony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly.\nWith the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device.\nJony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget\".\nIn post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters.\nBy contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures.\nThis leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects.\nA question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab.\nBut self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity\".\n\"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says.\n\"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe?\n\"How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well?\n\"How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety?\n\"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\"\nHe adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project.\n\"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says.\n\"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\"\nSo, nothing official yet.\nBut it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties.\nAnd if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future."

Let's play budget bingo.\n\"Osborne's austerity is wrong for Scotland\": There will be a squeeze of more than 5% (the Scottish government prefers a slightly different calculation rounding it up to 6%) in current or revenue (non-capital) spending.\n\"Difficult decisions have to be made\": If the health service is protected from cuts, and schools too, departments with less than half the budget have to absorb all the cuts.\nThat is likely to feature local government, which has been told to brace itself for some deep cuts in grant funding over the next five years.\nJohn Swinney could sweeten the pill by allowing them to raise council tax - as George Osborne did south of the border, allowing a 2% council tax rise if it is to pay for social care.\nBut it will be tempting to stick to a ninth year of freezing council tax, even though that will cost him a cumulated \u00c2\u00a3630m out of next year's budget, and even though it is more generous to those with the biggest bills.\n\"Taxes for a fairer Scotland\": That'll be the reason for not using the new Scottish Rate of Income Tax. Both Mr Swinney and the first minister have said they want to use income tax powers only when they are sufficiently flexible to tilt the burden towards those most able to pay it.\nThat will probably, eventually, mean a rise in higher rate tax, or changes to thresholds. That flexibility won't be added to this year's new powers until 2017.\n\"A healthy private rented housing market\": Mr Swinney could choose to follow Mr Osborne's example last month, by raising property transaction tax on buy-to-let homes. It would be a progressive move.\nBut the Scottish finance secretary doesn't need to burst a house price bubble in and around his capital city. He may also want to give landlords something they like, to make up for the boost to tenants' rights they are soon to face.\n\"ESA10\": Technical jargon for public finance nerds, but it matters a lot. Mr Swinney has to give more detail than he did last month on the constraints placed on capital projects by a European accounting rule that makes significant capital projects a public liability rather than the private one that had been planned.\n\"Scottish Fiscal Commission\": This independent, new-ish body will publish its reckoning of Mr Swinney's fiscal projections at the same time his draft budget is delivered. Watch for a shortfall in revenue from Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (the successor to Stamp Duty).\n\"The A9\": The road is busy, it's being dualled, slowly, and it runs right through Mr Swinney's constituency.\n\"PFI on steroids\": Labour's Jackie Baillie will complain about the \"debt mountain\" being built up under the SNP. Quoting a report from The Guardian about \u00c2\u00a315bn of council debt and the liabilities resulting from the Public Finance Initiative and its successors, she probably won't explain that a lot of it was built up while she was a minister.\n\"Capitulation to the powerful roads lobby\": Greens will complain that insufficient money has been directed towards household energy efficiency, and too much is going on building a new Forth crossing and Aberdeen ring road.\n\"Eye off the ball\": Conservatives will blame any and all shortcomings in public sector performance and economic performance on the SNP government's campaign for independence. It's a way of rallying 'No' voters. Watch Ruth Davidson for pointers towards manifesto tax cut pledges.\n\"Budget for fairness, for growth and for Scotland\": Whatever is announced, and whatever the reality, Mr Swinney will present his draft budget as all these and more.\n\"House!\" (Yes, more housing too. It will be a theme of the SNP election campaign.)"

One Western diplomat said he had been told recently by a Free Syrian Army commander that it was not possible to get any ammunition or other supplies in. Cut off from help, it was only a matter of time, perhaps, for the rebels.\nThere are other parts of Homs still, just, in rebel hands. But if they, along with Khalidiya, do fall, Homs will become just the latest in a line of regime victories on the battlefield.\nThe regime's forces have been steadily picking off some of the villages around Homs. Two months ago, with the help of Hezbollah, they recaptured the town of Qusair. The government has halted - if not quite turned around - a rebel advance on Damascus. Sources close to the regime say an offensive is also planned for the northern city of Aleppo.\nAfter Khalidiya, Syria conflict goes on\nIn pictures: Khalidiya devastation\nOn Monday, an unnamed army officer told Syrian state television: \"Today, we can report having complete control of the area of Khalidiya.\"\n\"That was a victory of all our fighters and the whole Syrian Army and especially our dear leader, Bashar al-Assad. And God willing, we will get rid of the terrorists in the entire country and the future will be free of killings and under the control of the army.\"\nHowever, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cast doubt on the claim.\nWhile the group acknowledged that government forces were in control of most of Khalidiya, it said fighting was continuing on Monday.\n\"Clashes took place between rebels and regime forces, supported by Hezbollah and National Defence Forces, in the southern parts of the Khalidiya neighbourhood,\" it said.\n\"Regime forces are bombarding parts, and military reinforcements are arriving as advancing regime forces try to establish full control.\"\nOpposition activists told the AFP news agency that about 90% of Khalidiya was now controlled by the army. One told the Associated Press that the battle for the district was \"almost over\".\nOn Sunday, the Arabic TV station al-Mayadeen, which is seen as close to the Syrian government, broadcast what it said was footage of Khalidiya, showing heavily damaged buildings and piles of rubble.\nIt also showed pictures of the interior of the historic Khaled bin Walid mosque, a focal point for anti-government protesters. Troops reportedly seized it on Saturday, days after activists accused them of firing shells at the tomb of Khaled bin Walid, a revered figure in Islam.\nOnly the Old City of Homs and a few other districts are still held by the opposition. On Monday, government jets bombed the Bab Hud district of the Old City, just south of Khalidiya, according to the Syrian Observatory."

We have become mere shells of our former selves.\"\nSpeaking after the verdict, Deputy Chief Constable of Sussex Police, Bernie O'Reilly, said the force had apologised to the Grice family.\n\"When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana's murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could,\" he said.\nDuring the two-week trial, Lane admitted he had stalked Miss Grice and had lied to police in interviews, but denied murder.\nHe had claimed he found her body and left her home without raising the alarm because he was in shock.\nBut the jury returned its guilty verdict after just over two hours of deliberation.\nThe court heard Lane refused to accept their break-up and was incensed when Miss Grice rekindled her relationship with ex-boyfriend Ashley Cooke, vowing to a friend: \"She'll pay for what she's done.\"\nProsecutor Philip Bennetts QC said: \"During their relationship, he stalked her. He put a tracker on her car and followed her movements.\n\"That obsession with her translated into killing her. He would not allow anyone else to be with her.\"\nTwo days before Miss Grice was killed, she met Lane at a hotel in Hove to insist their relationship was over, but Lane claimed they had sex earlier that day.\nThe evening before he killed her, he filled a red petrol can with fuel, but claimed he bought it to kill himself due to depression following his grandfather's death.\nThe car mechanic waited until she was alone at the bungalow she shared with two housemates before cutting her throat and trying to set fire to her room.\nProsecutors said one fire was started on the bed and another on the carpet, and Lane dismantled the smoke alarm in the hallway.\nAfter the killing, Lane withdrew \u00c2\u00a360 from Miss Grice's bank account and went to check a lottery ticket before he went to work at SE Tyres in Burgess Hill, where he was arrested.\nHe is due to be sentenced on Thursday.\nMr Justice Green warned Lane he faces a life sentence with a \"very substantial minimum term\".\nDuring the trial, the the court heard Miss Grice complained about her ex-boyfriend to police several times.\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is conducting an investigation into the contact between Miss Grice, Mr Lane and Sussex Police in the lead-up to her death.\nMr O'Reilly said: \"Within days of her murder I personally visited Shana's family to apologise on behalf of Sussex Police and we made a referral to the IPCC.\n\"We have thoroughly reviewed all aspects of how we deal with cases of stalking and harassment and we have now taken on the learning and our approach is more robust.\"\nAn IPCC spokesman said investigators had already interviewed a number of witnesses and further interviews would be carried out now the trial had finished."

The Lionesses last lost a competitive qualifier in November 2002.\nEngland had already qualified for next summer's tournament in the Netherlands thanks to the 5-0 thumping of Estonia on 15 September, but England boss Mark Sampson said before the match in Leuven that he was determined his team would end the qualifiers as group leaders.\nBelgium, the only team to have taken a point off Sampson's side during the campaign, could have finished top of Group 7 had they beaten England, but they never truly came close and must settle for second spot.\nNeither team impressed in a first half full of stray passes and pedestrian attacks. England's best chance fell to Lucy Bronze, whose long-range effort was a fraction wide from the top corner.\nBelgium also had an opportunity to break the deadlock and would probably have scored through a Tessa Wullaert in-swinging corner had Jill Scott not headed the danger away.\nBelgium were organised in defence and for most of the match were quick to close down playmaker Karen Carney whenever she received the ball, reducing her influence in the final third and consequently nullifying England.\nBut on the rare occasions Belgium did give Carney space to pull England's strings, the Chelsea forward was ruthless. First, she floated a lovely cross towards the industrious Parris to score her third international goal and followed up with five minutes remaining with a strike which completely wrong-footed Justien Odeurs thanks to the deflection.\nSampson has proved he is not afraid to make changes - tweaking the formation during this campaign and making two changes to the team which beat Estonia, with Siobhan Chamberlain and Gemma Davison replaced by Karen Bardsley and Gilly Flaherty.\nBut it was the introduction of Moore that changed the course of this match, with the midfielder breaking up play and giving the visitors more ballast in midfield.\nEngland's Euro 2017 preparations begin in earnest with a friendly against France, a team ranked third in the world, next month in Doncaster."

The NEC deny this is the fault of the UKIP system.\n\"Furthermore, highly confidential information about me held in party documents has been leaked to the press and the NEC has not sought to investigate this gross breach of privacy,\" he added.\nMr McGough - who has resigned from the NEC - said Mr Woolfe's exclusion from the contest was \"unfair\" and called into the question the party's future.\nUnless the party elected a \"competent leader who was comfortable with the media, it was finished\", he told World at One. \"This is a fight for survival. It is life or death.\"\nBBC political correspondent Tom Bateman said the NEC's decision \"opens up a whole new schism in UKIP\" and he understood that Mr Farage could call an emergency meeting of the party membership to put pressure on the body to reconsider.\nMr Oakden, who only took over as party chairman this week, said the party was perfectly entitled to call an EGM if 25% of its branches backed the move but said talk of a potential split was over-exaggerated and the remaining contenders were a diverse and exciting group.\nMEP Ms James - now regarded as the favourite in the contest - has launched her own campaign website while Mr Arnott, an MEP for the north east of England, has said he was won the backing of the party's deputy leader Paul Nuttall.\nOf the other candidates, Mr Etheridge is also a member of European Parliament while Lisa Duffy is a councillor in Cambridgeshire.

      "source": "The initial plan was to pass ownership to supporters' group Well Society in five years, but instead it has taken 14 months for the handover to be agreed.\nThis was always going to be the final outcome, since Hutchison was never interested in owning or running the club long-term.\nFor him, a Lanarkshire boy whose business career took him abroad and eventually into a life of significant wealth, the point was to contribute to his local community.\nChallenges remain, though, even if Hutchison believes much of the hard work has been carried out.\nThe significant progress is that costs have been cut, that investments have been made on infrastructure projects at Fir Park and on improving the chances of the football side of the business contributing to self-sustainability.\nHutchison is satisfied that in agreeing to sell his 76% shareholding for \u00a31 to the Well Society, he has paved the way for stability and fan ownership.\nIf there is a message from Hutchison, it is that fans and local businesses need to step up to support the club financially, so that it never needs to be reliant on wealthy individuals or investors.\n\"I can't speak to the future of any business, whether it's secure or otherwise, but if they have enough customers and they follow the strategy which has been implemented, we've significantly improved the probability of success,\" Hutchison told BBC Scotland from his home in Barbados.\n\"[The club] is extremely close [to break even]. In recent months, the player budget has been reduced dramatically, we've been able to sign some really excellent younger players on longer-term contracts, which reduces costs because you don't have to buy a much more experienced player, we've significantly reduced the medical bills by the introduction of the sports scientist.\n\"We could do with a little bit of a boost on the commercial side, but we have that pipeline of young talent coming through which would give the opportunity for additional transfer income.\n\"What [supporters] need to do is decide whether or not they want to try to make it work and whether they want to step up.\n\"The second, and probably more important one, is that I'd like to see more local companies participate more effectively with the club and the community.\"\nHutchison had to address costs at Fir Park since the club was running at a loss.\nBefore John Boyle's controlling interest was transferred in January 2015, Hutchison had to provide \u00a330,000 to pay bills. He has since invested \u00a3650,000 and \u00a3380,000 in loans, with at least \u00a3180,000 having been paid back, and the remaining repayment terms altered.\nMotherwell previously used to budget to finish in the top half of the Premiership, which meant that any drop in form had a significant impact on working capital.\nThat has changed, while 10 players left the club in January, although one of them - James McFadden - subsequently signed a new short-term deal until the end of the season.\nUnder Mark McGhee's management, the focus is to be on developing young players, and Hutchison is particularly proud that under his tenure, Motherwell have reached the youth cup final for the first time in 30 years.\nThe challenge, though, is financial as well as sporting. The income streams of football clubs rise and fall over the course of a season, but there is now no wealthy individual on hand to cover any shortfalls that might arise.\nThe Well Society's membership has plateaued, with some letting their subscriptions slide. The Society needs all of its members to be contributing and for more to join if money is to be raised to support the fan-ownership model.\n\"People got into a bit of a comfort zone that maybe they don't have to participate, 'it's okay, Les is here, don't worry about it',\" Hutchison said.\n\"From the very outset, I wasn't in the business of wanting to own or run a football club in Scotland, I am a philanthropist and I was trying to help the community.\n\"The Society have had up to 1700 people who have at some point in time contributed. All it takes is for people who have done it in the past to do it again and a few more, with also the support of local business who really want to support their local communities and customers, they need to step up a bit more as well.\n\"If that happens, then the thing will be in good hands.\n\"What [the club] has to do is manage the cash flow. That's the challenge. The cash comes in in peaks and troughs because of the way the league does their financing and the way that sponsors pay their money, and TV and so on.\n\"If they could build up some reasonable reserves, they can then manage through the peaks and troughs.\n\"We've been budgeting quite prudently. We've had to take actions to make sure those budgets can be achieved. It all bodes well at this point.\"\nHutchison has stabilised Motherwell - at a personal cost of \u00a31m - and has now left the supporters with the opportunity, and the challenge, of taking over. For that to happen, the Well Society will need to succeed in a way that it hasn't been able to achieve in the past."

Historically, smoking rates peaked far earlier among men than women.\nBreast, prostate, lung and bowel cancers remain the most common.\nAccording to PHW, cases of liver, mouth, throat and melanoma skin cancer saw the biggest percentage increases.\nThe rates of stomach cancer and prostate cancer decreased, while mesothelioma rates increased by almost a third.\nDr Huws said: \"We know that up to four in 10 of cancers in the population may be preventable.\n\"With an increasing number of cancer cases each year, cancer control is possible and important for future generations and for keeping rising health service demand in check.\n\"The good news is that we have seen significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.\n\"This is already bringing cancer rates down in men.\""

      "source": "Following the revelations of inappropriate relationships, the home affairs select committee has called for an urgent review of laws governing undercover policing.\nHere are the women's accounts of how they felt when it emerged that their relationships, which lasted from two to six years, were based on deception. These are not their real names.\n\"I was absolutely shocked and devastated,\" she told MPs.\nLisa had a six-year relationship with former PC Mark Kennedy, who posed as long-haired dropout Mark \"Flash\" Stone to infiltrate a group of environmental protesters.\n\"You imagine that somebody may be in public meetings that environmental groups have. You imagine there might be somebody listening in there. You could even imagine that your phone might be tapped or that somebody might look at your emails.\n\"But to know that there was somebody in your bed for six years, that somebody was involved in your family life to such a degree, that was an absolute shock.\n\"Well, 'shock' is an understatement. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me and my sense of what was reality and what wasn't was completely turned on its head.\"\nDuring the hearing she was asked whether she had any sympathy for Mr Kennedy, who is suing the Metropolitan Police claiming he had been traumatised by what had happened.\n\"As a human being it is very difficult not to have sympathy for somebody that I cared about deeply, but it is also important to remember that that person that I cared about deeply did not in fact exist,\" she replied.\nShe adds that she still has questions about what happened.\n\"Who was listening in to our most intimate phone calls? Who saw our holiday photos? Was there anybody following us when we were on holiday?\n\"Who made the decisions about what happened to my life, where I was allowed to go, who I was allowed to see, which I thought was my free will but actually was being manipulated by this person who was being controlled by other people?\"\n\"We weren't married, clearly, but we shared the same flat. He was completely integrated into my life for five years and then one day he disappeared,\" she said.\nAlison had a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy, who she met through a group she was involved with in 1994. But he was in fact an undercover police officer. She told MPs the revelation had an \"enormous impact\" on her life.\n\"The experience has left me with many, many unanswered questions, and one of those that comes back is: how much of the relationship was real?,\" she told MPs.\n\"Some of the consequences of that have meant that I have, for the last 13 years, questioned my own judgment and it has impacted seriously on my ability to trust, and that has impacted on my current relationship and other subsequent relationships.\nAlison, a peaceful campaigner involved in left-wing political causes, believes she inadvertently provided him with \"an excellent cover story\", helping persuade other activists he was genuine.\nShe said he became totally integrated into her family, appearing in her mother's wedding photograph, accompanying her on holidays and supporting her through the bereavement of a close friend.\n\"This is not about just a lying boyfriend or a boyfriend who has cheated on you. It is not even about a boyfriend who is having another relationship with somebody else. It is about a fictional character who was created by the state and funded by taxpayers' money.\"\n\"You do not know who you can trust any more. It destroys everything,\" she said.\nWhen the boyfriend Clare knew as John Barker disappeared two years into their relationship, she was determined to track him down. She found a death certificate for his name, and discovered he had been using the identity of a child who had died of leukaemia aged eight.\nShe visited the child's house, but their parents no longer lived there.\n\"He had told me that his parents were dead when we were in a relationship, so I wasn't expecting to see the parents, but I thought that if I went there... he had been a missing person for however long and I was desperate to find him. I was really concerned about his welfare,\" she explained.\n\"Nothing made sense of what had happened, and so I went there desperate, thinking I have to follow every clue that I have, and I thought maybe some other members of the family may still live there or somebody might know where he was.\"\nShe said people trying to justify the practice saying things like it prevented terrorism, was very distressing.\n\"This is not about a need to do it. It is about a desire to do it. They have the power and they think they can get away with it. That is what it is about.\n\"It is deeply distressing, and I do not think it should be allowed in any circumstances. It is so intrusive into people's lives, and, as my friends have said, it turns your life upside down.\n\"Everything that you thought you knew suddenly becomes unreal; everything changes,\" she said."

It didn't matter who I played.\n\"He played good but in the first session, I feel, if I had my normal tip I would have been in front.\"\nDing still had to take his opportunities and he did so in devastating style.\nWilliams was so accustomed to sitting in his chair during a one-sided start to the evening session, that Ding had to remind his opponent to get up and go in for a break.\nThe Welshman then joked that he had Ding \"rattled\" and his \"head had gone\" when he tweeted during the interlude.\nDing, who last reached the semi-finals in 2011, has dropped down to 17 in the world and had to qualify for this year's tournament.\nBut the 29-year-old looked to be reaping the reward of so much time in play during a one-sided morning session where he was sharp and fluent in taking six from seven frames after Williams won the opener.\nAnd he sealed victory with little fuss, grabbing his 11th score of more than 50 on his way.\n\"I got some easy chances in the match because Mark had a lot of bad kicks,\" Ding said. \"And every player has a big problem if they have a new tip.\n\"I controlled the game, took my chances and made some good breaks. I was confident. Every time I saw a chance I thought I could go for it and pot it.\"\nIn the evening's other match, world number one Mark Selby maintained his four-frame advantage over gutsy qualifier Kyren Wilson to lead 10-6 with a session to play.\nWilson, who beat top-10 seeds Joe Perry and Mark Allen to reach the last eight, had chances in the first three frames but lost them all as the 2014 champion Selby built a 6-0 lead.\nThe Kettering man responded by taking the next two and then won a scrappy ninth frame of a disjointed match to get to within three.\nBut Selby's famed matchplay saw him keep his rival at bay and he won a tense final frame to avoid his lead being reduced to two frames.\nWilson and Selby return to finish their match on Wednesday morning."

      "source": "But the message may take some time to reach India.\nThe country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs.\nAnd deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights.\nIndia is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\n'Second-class' citizens\nEven before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village.\nSeveral athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches.\nTaking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. \"I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,\" he said.\nThe channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit.\nIt's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves.\nIndia may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\nSpeaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians.\nHe said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India.\n\"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said.\nThere is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete.\nWhile officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper.\nMost schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac\nWhile stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed.\nHe hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others.\nHis training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training.\nToday the result is there for everyone to see. And he hopes that his achievement will transcend the boundaries of sporting achievement and change the attitude of people towards disabled in India.\nBBC Monitoringreports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days.\nWhat the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. But they could also tease out a second signal stemming from the way water rises and falls as a result of the tilting of the land. And, in fact, the latter effect sits on top of the first and is responsible for most of the amplitude change.\nThe team says the measurement was made to an accuracy of just 0.1 mm over the loch's 35 km length.\n\"We had to extract the tidal signal and get rid of all the noise. This involved very high precision,\" explained David Pugh.\n\"For example, the loch surface itself goes up and down every day by four centimetres just due to the pump storage scheme for hydroelectric generation, and we have to pull out a very small signal within that.\n\"The holy grail would be to learn from the effects of the tides something about the Earth's crust.  So the more precise we can get, the more we may learn about the crust.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter"

      "source": "In a series of Freedom of Information requests, BBC Scotland asked how many cases, concerns and complaints of child exploitation, and child sexual exploitation were recorded in the past four years.\nBut the force said the figures were not held on a single system.\nScotland's Children's Commissioner said the revelation was \"disturbing\".\nIt comes on the day that officers launched a new unit to help with what police acknowledge is the complex problem of child abuse and neglect across Scotland.\nIt will provide expertise to allow local teams to robustly investigate cases, including child sexual exploitation, online offences and other types of abuse.\nIn its response to the BBC's FOI requests, Police Scotland said: \"Child exploitation covers a broad range of criminal activity and doesn't correlate to a specific offence, but rather can involve a range of differing offences...The level of data you have requested is not held on a single system.\"\nIt comes after the publication last summer of the Jay report into sexual exploitation in Rotherham in South Yorkshire.\nIt revealed that more than 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse.\nLast year Glasgow City Council said 97 children in the city were victims, or at risk of, sexual exploitation.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers said most forces in England and Wales now put a marker on such offences in their records, but senior officers here say that it is not easy to do.\nChildren's Commissioner Tam Baillie said: \"I am disturbed that we do not yet collect police figures on children who are the subject of sexual exploitation.\n\"This was a recommendation of the Scottish Parliament and features in the Scottish government action plan on child sexual exploitation.\n\"The reason this is so important is that unless we know the scope of the problem we are trying to deal with, then we won't have the appropriate or proportionate response.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham, from Police Scotland, said the nature of child sexual exploitation made it highly unlikely that young people would come forward to report being abused.\n\"Our priority is to be focussing on identifying as many victims as we can and identifying perpetrators who have the intent to commit these devastating crimes so we can prevent the abuse from happening,\" he said.\n\"Scotland is at the forefront of approaches to child sexual exploitation.\n\"Sexual exploitation is a form of abuse and it is not a specific crime type recorded as such. Children and young people may be victim of repeated rapes, physical assaults or grooming offences and we categorise all of these in crime recording.\"\nHe added: \"But what is most important here is our focus on identifying who these victims are.\n\"Our focus is always on where there are child protection issues, and on keeping children safe.\"\nMartin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: \"Rotherham was a real wake-up call and led to the Scottish government's national action plan last year but we could and should be doing more.\n\"Our concern is that we don't know the full extent of the problem. We welcome the work of the police.\n\"Since the publication of the Barnardo's Scotland petition in 2011 we have been pushing for a better understanding of child sexual exploitation in Scotland.\"\nIn January 2013, Aileen Campbell, Minister for Children and Young People, responded to the Public Petitions Committee inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland, and announced four points including, action \"to improve the way child sexual exploitation is identified by Scotland's new single police force to make this form of abuse more visible\".\nHowever, sexual exploitation per se is still not recorded or centrally collated.\nThe Scottish government said figures are available on the wider problem of child abuse.\nA spokeswoman said: \"The safety of our children is a key priority for the government and an issue we take extremely seriously.\n\"The launch of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit will help to target and bring to justice those who seek to harm our young people.\n\"The unit has been set up to tackle all forms of child abuse, and child sexual exploitation is one aspect of this. We have robust legislation in place to cover a wide range of these offences, including online abuse and are working to strengthen the law even further.\"\nShe added: \"The extent of the problem is often difficult to assess because abuse by its very nature is concealed. That's why prevention and swift action to safeguard children are a big part of our strategy to tackle these terrible crimes.\n\"This includes robust National Child Protection guidance, action to tackle emerging forms of child abuse including child sexual exploitation, a national public awareness campaign and guidance for night-time workers such as taxi drivers and hotel staff who may come into contact with those at risk.\""

And Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said he could not accept negotiations that looked like blackmail.\nSince January 2015, a million migrants and refugees have entered the EU by boat from Turkey to Greece. More than 132,000 have arrived this year alone.\nTens of thousands are now stuck in Greece as their route north has been blocked.\n\"Germany will negotiate intensively because we have to improve the humanitarian situation in Greece,\" Mrs Merkel said.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said if a deal could be reached the influx of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands could be stopped \"in three to four weeks\".\nUnder initial proposals, for each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey, a different Syrian would be resettled in the EU directly from the country.\nIn return, the EU would double financial aid to Turkey promised last year, make a fresh push on talks over Turkey's eventual membership of the EU and offer visa-free travel to Europe's Schengen states.\nHowever, those proposals have since been watered down, lowering expectation on greater financial help and talks on EU membership and linking visa-free travel to 72 conditions to which Turkey must agree.\nEU member Cyprus has threatened to veto a deal. The Greek Cypriot government is not recognised by Turkey.\nThe Spanish foreign minister has said Spain will oppose the \"blanket return\" of refugees to Turkey.\nStressing what he called the UK's special status in the EU, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would not be offering visa-free access to Turkey. What mattered was \"busting the business model of the people smugglers\".\nA number of EU countries have raised concerns about what is on offer to Turkey amid a clampdown by the Ankara government on academics and journalists.\nGerman magazine Der Spiegel said on Thursday it had withdrawn its Istanbul correspondent, Hasnain Kazim, after the authorities refused to renew his press accreditation.\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the talks with Turkey would not just focus on migration.\n\"We have the internal situation in Turkey we are working on, being it the human rights and the rule of law issues, being it the necessary process with the Kurds to reopen spaces for peace,\" she said.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."

Being born in Wales has nothing to do with being Welsh.\n\"I cannot wait to send you and the anti-white garbage that you stand for back to the Third World dumps that you came from.\"\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said it had compiled more than 100 incidents of reported hate crimes since the result.\nDr Shuja Shafi, the body's secretary general, said: \"Now we are witnessing the shocking extent of this with reports around the country of hate speech and minorities being targeted.\n\"Our country is experiencing a political crisis which, I fear threatens the social peace.\"\nHe said he would be writing to the home secretary to ask what measures were being taken to step up security and policing in areas where such incidences have been reported.\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said he had asked the capital's Metropolitan Police to be on heightened alert for any rise in hate crime.\n\"I take seriously my responsibility to defend London's fantastic mix of diversity and tolerance,\" he said.\n\"So it's really important we stand guard against any rise in hate crimes or abuse by those who might use last week's referendum as cover to seek to divide us.\"\nHe added it was important not to demonise the 1.5 million people in London who voted for Brexit, and they should not be accused \"of being xenophobic or racist\".\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said officers would \"investigate vigorously any reports of crime motivated by hatred\".\nKaren Bradley, the minister for preventing abuse, exploitation and crime, said \"nobody in this country should live in fear because of who they are\".\n\"The government is working closely with communities to increase reporting and increase confidence that their concerns about hate crime will be taken seriously by the police and courts,\" she said.\nNo official statistics for reported incidents or racism or hate crime across the UK have yet been published. They are compiled by individual police forces.\nThe MP for Birmingham Yardley, Jess Phillips, has tweeted that she will ask a Parliamentary question on the issue.\nHowever, numerous people have posted accounts of personal experiences on Twitter alongside the hashtag #PostRefRacism.\nSky News presenter Adam Boulton tweeted: \"This weekend I and my family have witnessed 3 \"when are you going home?\" Racist incidents aimed at EU citizens here.\"\nBBC journalist Sima Kotecha tweeted: \"In utter shock: just been called p**i in my home town! Haven't heard that word here since the 80s..!\"\nAnother user, James Titcombe, tweeted: \"Daughter tells me someone wrote '[Child's name] go back to Romania' on the wall in the girls toilets at School today.\""

She said the policy was aimed at helping farmers and denied any day-to-day involvement in the running of the scheme.\nThe Supreme Court will decide on 19 March whether to pursue the criminal case.\nAdditionally, Finance Minister Sommai Phasee said on Wednesday that the ministry had received a letter from the national corruption watchdog urging it to pursue civil suit against Ms Yingluck to recover losses of 600bn baht ($18.4bn; \u00c2\u00a311.9bn) related to the scheme.\n\"The finance ministry oversees damages to the state and is ready to take action,\" he said.\nThe military seized power in May 2014 in what it said was a bid to restore public order after months of occasionally violent street protests against Ms Yingluck's government.\nBut Thailand has been embroiled in a cycle of political instability since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister in 2006.\nThe Shinawatra family are hugely popular among Thailand's rural population but are hated by the urban middle-class and elite who accuse them of corruption.\nThaksin-linked parties, under various different names, have won every election since 2001."

This would have been the third successive quarter of India's economy growing faster than China's. But because India has revised down the figure from October to December, it means China was still ahead in that period.

But analysts have said the new data do not correlate with other economic indicators, including industrial and factory production.\nShilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics said: \"The economy is not as strong as the GDP numbers might suggest.\n\"The numbers should not have any bearing on policies and both the central bank as well as the government should look at other activity indicators.\n\"For example, auto sales have dropped sharply this year, while bank lending growth had slowed to rates not seen in over a decade.\"\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who won last year's general elections, promised to reform and revive the economy and to attract much-needed foreign investment.\nBut many say the country is yet to see any of the \"big bang reforms\" he promised to deliver."

Moving forward you always have to have the will to improve and exceed expectations.\n\"I don't put pressure on myself. I just see it as a challenge.\"\nThe left-hander believes he should have reached the 1,000-run milestone in 2013.\n\"If I didn't give away a couple of innings I would have got there,\" he said.\n\"I spent my winter in Sydney and definitely improved. I feel I've opened up a few areas through the offside I may not have had previously and am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs.\n\"The only difference is when you are in and on 40, that you give it away. If you convert those into slightly higher scores, when then there is no reason why you should get out, then I will be at 1,200 runs.\n\"I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it.\"\nAhead of the current match against Nottinghamshire at Hove, Wells had scored 221 runs in his five Championship appearances this season - with his high score of 79 not out coming against Somerset in April.\nHe admits he is \"a fair way\" off his target but is keen to contribute to Sussex's title challenge, with the Hove side currently fifth in the Division One table.\nI am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it\n\"I feel in really good nick at the moment and that there's a big three-figure score just around the corner,\" he said.\n\"I know if I keep doing the same things and backing myself I'll score a good amount of runs.\n\"It may sound cliched but if I get a thousand runs and we win the title then brilliant. If I get 900 and we win the title I'll take that. As long as the runs I'm scoring are contributing to winning efforts that is most important.\n\"We have got a strong squad and one hallmark of this season so far is competition for batting spaces. Everyone is under pressure as you know you need to get your runs.\n\"That is the way it should be in any squad. You shouldn't be able to rest on your laurels as people around you want to take your spot.\"\nThe former England Under-19 international, who is the son of former Sussex captain and one-time England Test player Alan, believes his time in Australia has improved his all-round game.\n\"I had a clear basic goal which was to work on a couple of technical areas to do with my trigger and my stance to be in a better position so that I can move more freely and make me more dynamic at the crease,\" he said.\n\"I feel I am a lot quicker on my feet, which will help in all formats of my game. I've worked on shots through the off-side, my one-day skills in general and my fitness.\"\nWells, meanwhile, describes his efforts to break into Sussex's one-day side as \"difficult and frustrating\".\nThe Eastbourne-born player has only made one competitive Twenty20 appearance for the club, coming against Glamorgan in 2011, and has made just a handful of appearances in List A competition.\nSussex have performed strongly in both Twenty20 and 40-over competition in recent years, but made group-stage exits in both formats in 2013.\nWells says the county calendar has not helped his cause but hopes the new schedule, which sees the T20 Blast played throughout the season and the new 50-over One Day Cup played in July and August, could benefit him.\n\"So far in my career I've started well in four-day competition then T20 comes along, I have a big break in the middle of my season and I try to find a way to keep the momentum going,\" he said.\n\"It has been quite hard work. I think this year with the Friday nights will help.\n\"I've been pushing as hard as I can and have been working a lot on my one-day skills. I can strike a ball as far as anyone in the squad.\n\"It is just about putting it all together into performances in the middle.\n\"It is hard with the schedule in and around four-day cricket to find time to play second XI T20 games.\n\"You need your currency, as it were, to show the coaches that you can do it.\"\nWells did play five CB40 matches for Sussex last season but only managed to make seven runs in four innings.\n\"Unfortunately last year I did get a run at the top of the order but I got out,\" he said.\n\"They were classic dismissals - a caught behind and a couple of lbws - but that's the way it goes.

It does not reflect the support crew and the riders that I see around me.\n\"At the same time, I completely understand why people feel let down by the way in which the situation has been handled, and going forward we need to do better.\n\"I would like to apologise for this on behalf of myself and the other riders of Team Sky who feel passionately about our sport and winning clean.  I believe in the people around me, and what we are doing.\n\"With respect to Dave Brailsford, he has created one of the best sports teams in the world. Without Dave B, there is no Team Sky.\n\"He has supported me throughout the last seven years of my career and I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunities and the experiences I've had.  By his own admission, mistakes have been made, but protocols have been put in place to ensure that those same mistakes will not be made again.\n\"I know it will take time for faith to be restored, but I will do my utmost to ensure that happens, along with everyone else at Team Sky.\"\nBBC sports editor Dan Roan\nThis may appear to be Chris Froome belatedly backing his under-fire boss Sir Dave Brailsford, but read the careful wording closely and it is clear that his support is very, very qualified. This is different from the \"100% backing\" messages that several of Froome's  team-mates gave to the Team Sky principal last week.\nInstead, Froome seems to be taking a more pragmatic stand, making the point that unless Brailsford stays, Sky's sponsorship may cease, and the team could fold. This is how high the stakes have now become for one of the most successful professional teams in sport."

A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.\"\nJudge Gorsuch is a so-called originalist, meaning he believes the US Constitution should be followed as the Founding Fathers intended.\nIf successful, his nomination will restore the 5-4 conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.\nProtests against Mr Trump's choice were held outside the Supreme Court following the announcement.\nAbortion: He has not spoken out about Roe v Wade, the case which legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, making in difficult to pin down where he stands on the issue.\nBirth control: Judge Gorsuch has supported religious institutions which objected to requirements for employers to provide access to contraception. In one of his most high-profile cases, he defended the religious owners of retailer Hobby Lobby who refused to fund birth control via staff health insurance.\nGun rights: He hasn't ruled directly on firearms restrictions, but is thought to be generally pro-second amendment. He once wrote in a legal opinion that a citizen's right to bear arms \"must not be infringed lightly\".\nEuthanasia: He has been vocal about assisted dying, writing a book in 2009 which opposed legalisation.\nA conservative's dream: Anthony Zurcher, North America Reporter\nDonald Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee is a fairly traditional pick in a decidedly untraditional time.\nJudge Gorsuch has a CV and background that would make him a natural selection for just about any Republican president.\nHe's the kind of Supreme Court nominee evangelical and traditional conservative voters dreamed of as a reward for sticking with Mr Trump through the general election despite campaign missteps, controversies and occasional political apostasies.\nThey knew they would get a court pick they wouldn't like if Hillary Clinton won. They hoped they would get someone like Judge Gorsuch if Mr Trump prevailed.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are left fuming over Senate Republicans' precedent-breaking decision to stymie Barack Obama's attempts to fill this court vacancy for nearly 10 months.\nThey have to decide if they will try to derail Mr Gorsuch's nomination as retribution - perhaps forcing Republicans to break with another Senate tradition, the ability of a minority to a block a Supreme Court nominee with only 41 votes through a filibuster.\nThe party's base, feeling a liberal majority on the court was stolen from them, will demand lockstep resistance, likely setting up a divisive confirmation fight ahead.\nJudge Gorsuch's nomination is expected to spark a political showdown in the Senate.\nFormer President Barack Obama had put forward Judge Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia's death last February.\nBut Republicans refused to debate the choice, saying it was too close to an election, which left Democrats embittered.\nEven if Judge Gorsuch makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will still face challenges when the entire chamber convenes for a final vote.\nDemocrats may seek to prevent that second vote by prolonging or filibustering the debate. In that case, the nomination would need 60 votes rather than a simple majority.\nWith Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee.\nThe highest court in the US is often the ultimate arbiter on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions.\nIt hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June.\nEach of the nine justices serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate.\nThe court already has cases this term on the rights of transgender students, gerrymandered voting districts and on the Texas death penalty determination.\nIt is also likely the court will hear cases on voter rights, abortion, racial bias in policing and US immigration policy, and possibly on Mr Trump's controversial executive order banning refugees."

      "source": "Gaby Scanlon, of Heysham, Lancashire, was served the Nitro-Jagermeister while celebrating her 18th birthday in 2012.\nOscar's Wine Bar in Lancaster previously admitted health and safety failings, at Preston Crown Court.\nThe court heard Ms Scanlon was left close to death after drinking the \u00a33.95 shot.\nShe was taken to Lancaster Royal Infirmary, where a CT scan found a large perforation in her stomach.\nMs Scanlon, now 20, spent three weeks in hospital, undergoing surgery to remove her stomach and connect her oesophagus directly to her small bowel.\nHer solicitors told the court the experience, on 4 October 2012, had \"completed changed\" her life.\nShe now suffers from \"episodes of agonising pain\", has to avoid some foods and can no longer enjoy eating, they said.\nDescribing the moment she drank the shot, Ms Scanlon told the court: \"I turned to the man and asked if it was okay to drink. He said 'Yes'.\n\"Smoke was coming from my nose and mouth.  Straight away I knew something was not right.  My stomach expanded.\"\nOscar's Wine Bar Ltd, registered in Swinton, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to one count of failing in the duty of an employer to ensure the safety of persons not in its employment, admitting it failed to ensure the shot cocktail was safe for consumption.\nNo risk assessment was carried out regarding the potential dangers of the drinks.\nThe firm's director Andrew Dunn, of Old Earswick, York, pleaded not guilty to his part in the company's failings.\nThe prosecution said it would offer no evidence against him if he made a \u00a320,000 contribution to the court costs prior to sentencing.\nA spokesman for Lancaster City Council said: \"We took the view that in the public interest it was not necessary to prosecute Mr Dunn, taking into account the interests of the family.\"\nPassing sentence, Judge Pamela Badley said the bar's actions \"fell very far short of standards\".\nLiquid nitrogen was present in the Nitro-Jagermeister shot to create a cloud of smoke in the glass.\nWhile such drinks are not illegal, physicists say the liquid must completely evaporate before the drink is safe for consumption.\nThe court heard the bar had sold a range of cocktails using the chemical after Mr Dunn saw similar drinks in the Berkeley Hotel in London.\nHe was said to have found them \"alluring and intrigued by the dramatic effect\".\nBut senior health and safety officer Peter Lord, who visited the bar in May 2012, said he had concerns about the drinks and sent a letter with guidance on liquid nitrogen usage, which was met with no response.\nThe family-run bar's barrister Kevin McLoughlin said the family had been left \"mortified\" and apologised to Miss Scanlon and her family for the \"errors and misjudgements that were made\".\nHe said: \"The company and the family are truly sorry.  At no time did they see anything warning them of the risks of ingestion.\n\"The essence of this calamity was the ignorance on the part of the company.\""

The disease has been found in a number of male sports stars - including many former American football players.\nCTE cases can only be diagnosed after examination of the brain post-mortem.\nChastain's decision follows that of her team mate, Cindy Parlow Cone, who has also decided to donate her brain.\nBoth women have been calling on football regulators to introduce regulation preventing children under the age of 14 from heading the ball.\nResearch into CTE has thrown the spotlight on several sports, including American football, horse-racing and rugby in recent months.\nA Hollywood film about the effects of concussion on National Football League stars was released last year, starring Will Smith.\nIn February, it was revealed Ken Stabler, one of the most celebrated quarterbacks of all time, had been suffering from the disease.\nChastain became well known for scoring America's winning goal in a penalty shoot-out against China in the final of the 1999 Women's World Cup.\nImages of the football star kneeling on the pitch in her black sports bra, fists clenched, swept around the world, becoming an iconic image for women's football."

This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks.\nIf that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months.\nIn the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border.

      "source": "It says the current TV deals saw Premier League clubs generate \u00a33.3bn record revenues in 2014-15, up by 3%.\nTop flight clubs also recorded a second straight year of pre-tax profits in 2014-15, for the first time since 1999.\nWith more lucrative TV deals from 2016, Deloitte says clubs are \"looking at at least three more years of big growth\".\nLaunching its 25th Annual Review of Football Finance, Dan Jones from the business consultancy's Sport Business Group said: \"What we are seeing is a continuation of club profitability, it is certainly not a one-off.\n\"We feel Premier League clubs have turned the corner, and are entering a new era of sustained profitability. Clubs are now attractive propositions to investors, and not merely as vanity projects.\"\nHe said increased profitability meant that top flight English clubs could compete with overseas teams in order to buy up the best players in the world, and still have money left in reserve.\nFrom 2016-17 clubs will receive even more cash from broadcasters, with Sky and BT Sport paying a record \u00a35.136bn (up from \u00a33.018bn in 2013-16) for live Premier League TV rights for three seasons.\n\"When the enhanced new broadcast deals commence in the 2016-17 season, operating profits could rise as high as \u00a31bn,\" Mr Jones said.\nHe also said that it was encouraging to see that much of this new-found TV wealth was being spent by clubs not only on players, but also on improving stadia and infrastructure.\n\"The pace of football's financial growth in two and a half decades is staggering,\" said Mr Jones, referring to the foundation of the Premier League in 1992.\n\"By half-time of the second televised Premier League game next year, more broadcast revenue will have been generated than during the whole of the First Division season 25 years ago.\"\nHe added: \"The impact of the Premier League's broadcast deal is clear to see. For the first time, the Premier League leads the football world in all three key revenue categories - commercial, match day and broadcast - and this is driving sustainable profitability.\nAlthough the wages/revenue ratio has increased for the Premier League clubs, Mr Jones does not see this as cause for concern.\n\"Wage costs grew at a faster rate than revenues in 2014-15 and as a result the division's wages/revenue ratio rose from 58% to 61%,\" he said.\n\"However, this represents the second lowest level since 2004-05 and is 10 percentage points lower than in 2012-13.\n\"In fact, in the last two years, only 30% of revenue increases have been consumed by wage growth, whereas in the five years to 2012-13 this figure was 99%.\"\nPremier League highlights 2014-15\nThe 92 clubs in the English Premier League and Football League generated more than \u00a34bn in revenues for the first time in 2014-15, a new record.\nMeanwhile,  the UK government's tax take from the top 92 professional football clubs in 2014-15 was roughly \u00a31.5bn, up from \u00a31.4bn the previous season.\nDeloitte's review of football finance also found that combined revenue for the \"big five\" European leagues (England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France) rose 6% to a record \u20ac12bn (\u00a39.2bn) in 2014-15.\nWhile the Premier League, Bundesliga and Spain's La Liga were profitable, Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1 generated combined operating losses.\nIn England's second tier, the Championship, combined revenues grew 12% to \u00a3548m in 2014-15, exceeding \u00a3500m for the first time.\n\"Wage costs rose by 4% to \u00a3541m which, despite a reduction in the wages/revenue ratio from 106% in 2013-14 to 99%, means clubs spent almost as much on wages as they generated in revenue,\" said Deloitte.\n\"This remains an unsustainable level of spending without the support of owner funding. This resulted in operating losses of \u00a3225m and a combined pre-tax loss of \u00a3191m.\"\nIn Scotland, Celtic's failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League contributed to a fall in Premiership clubs' aggregate revenues of 9%, or some \u00a313m.\nHowever, the Glasgow club still accounted for 50% of all revenues in the division, as they lifted the title for a fourth successive year.\nDeloitte said a new deal to market the international (non EEA - European Economic Area) TV rights  meant Scottish football was now being shown in more than 100 countries."

If Mr Cameron prevails, it concludes, \"Hungarians working in Britain can say goodbye to part of their welfare benefits... but they lose even more if supporters of quitting win\".\nTomasz Bielecki, Brussels correspondent of Poland's liberal Gazeta Wyborcza, agrees that migrant workers like the Poles \"will pay most for Mr Cameron's compromise\", but concludes that \"if it keeps Britain in the EU, it's a price worth paying\".\nA British exit would weaken the European Union, especially in its dealings with Russia, and possibly lead to a \"nightmare domino effect\" with other countries departing, he fears.\nMr Bielecki says the prime minister's best hope is to focus on the overall advantages of the European Union rather than letting his opponents sidetrack the debate into \"marginal issues - including the Brussels deal\".\nOther commentators agree that the referendum has implications far beyond British politics.\nJochen Buchsteiner in Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung notes that Conservative Brexit campaigners are pitching their appeal on the \"primacy of national sovereignty\".\nThey may well start asking whether Germany will demand concessions from Britain on refugees in return for the Brussels deal, which he says \"owed much\" to Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nHis concern is that a European Union still dominated by immigration, the euro crisis and \"political helplessness\" in June might persuade many voters that EU exit would not be a \"leap in the dark\" but rather a case of \"stepping into the light\".\nLegal analyst Araceli Mangas also has concerns about the referendum, in Spain's conservative El Pais.\nHe writes that Britain remaining in the EU \"matters a great deal\", and a win for Brexit would \"encourage all sorts of populists\".\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

I thought it was very funny, I must admit,\" he told the ABC.\n\"What's not funny is the selling off of this country. We hate it and we're tenaciously opposed to it.\"\nQueensland Senator Barry O'Sullivan called the ad \"abhorrent\" and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said it was \"unfortunate\".\nOn the Sunrise breakfast television program, presenter David Koch pressed Mr Katter on why he released the video so soon after a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nMr Katter responded that there were similar advertisements that did not cause controversy and also claimed not to be aware of the shooting.\nIf this is the best Australia has to offer in the way of political scandal, then we truly are witnessing the world's most boring election campaign.\nMr Katter's ad is typical of Australia's larrikin sense of humour - politically incorrect, jarring and perhaps not quite as funny as it thinks it is.\nBut is it \"abhorrent\" or in \"the worst of taste\"? Should it have been released in the aftermath of the shootings in Orlando?\nAustralia is a long way from Florida and many people in regional centres will share Mr Katter's bawdy sense of humour.\nSometimes humour is rough or tasteless. Sometimes it doesn't hit the bulls eye. But if Katter's constituents don't like his joke, they can toss him out at the election on 2 July.\nBetoota Advocate editor Clancy Overell, who played one of the shot men in the video, said he was aware the video might \"wind people up\" but was not sure Mr Katter had the same understanding.\nMr Overell defended the video's timing, telling the BBC that shootings occurred in the US every day.\n\"Australians can't be prevented from making jokes and about cowboys and western-style gunplay,\" he said.\nA video from the 2012 Queensland state election featured Mr Katter line dancing with a group of young people.\nThe same video depicted him spinning on his head, although it is likely a body double was used for the stunt."

She said, 'stay here as long as you like, take deep breaths, be present'.\n\"It was perfect, really.\"\nEntry to the exhibition, which lasts for 10 weeks, is free but only 160 people can be admitted at a time. Each can stay as long as they wish, with the gallery imposing a \"one in - one out\" policy.\nAbramovic herself opened the gallery doors at 10:00 BST - as she will every day - by which point there were already hundreds of acolytes and art lovers queuing in Kensington Gardens.\nGeraldine, an art professor from Kensington, had arrived at 06:30 BST to be amongst the first to see the performance.\n\"It was like being at a very beautiful party where nobody talks,\" she told the BBC. \"It may push me into doing some meditation, which is probably very good for me, so it changed my life in a very positive way.\"\n\"Just to sit and get lost in one's thoughts, I think it's very relaxing,\" said Andrew, a psychiatrist visiting the UK from San Francisco.\n\"And certainly some people were crying, too, so perhaps it brings up some thoughts that one pushes down from normal life.\"\nThe show is titled 512 Hours, after the amount of time Abramovic will spend in the gallery.\nIt is her first performance work since The Artist is Present, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she sat motionless, six days a week, looking directly at whoever sat down in a chair placed opposite her.\nBoth shows lack the startling drama of her earlier performances, including one in which she systematically stabbed her hand with knives.\nIn another, she whipped herself, before cutting a five-point star in her stomach with a razor blade and lying on a cross made of ice.\nOnce, she nearly died after lying in the middle of a burning cross made of petrol-soaked sawdust. On another occasion, she allowed an audience member to hold a loaded gun to her head.\nNonetheless, she told the BBC her latest show \"really frightens me\".\n\"I worry about the British public,\" she said, adding that the public's cynicism might get in the way of creating \"a pure emotional connection\".\n\"My only chance with the British public is to be vulnerable,\" she told Radio 4's Front Row. \"The audience is someone who completes the work.\"\nAhead of the show, the 67-year-old was accused of failing to acknowledge other artists who engage in the \"art of nothing\".\nTwo weeks ago, a  group of US art historians curators wrote to the Serpentine, asking it to recognise the influence of Mary Ellen Carroll. a conceptual artist who has been working on a project called \"Nothing\" since 2006, when she went to Argentina with only her passport.\nBut Abramovic dismissed the accusations, telling the BBC: \"There is nothing on the walls of the gallery, no work. But I am working eight hours a day with the energy of the public.\"\nDuring the first hour of the first day of her performance, Abramovic seemed to be playing a giant game of cosmic yogic chess, with the public as her pieces, positioned carefully throughout the gallery.\nThere was something eerie about entering a room full of bodies frozen in space but, once guided into position, most of the visitors reported feeling an overwhelming sense of wellbeing.\n\"I started seeing the sky - the clouds in the sky - in the white of the wall,\" said Chester, a TV producer who had skipped work to attend the opening.\n\"It was a religious experience. I think you'd have to sum it up as that.\"\nAbramovic says the performance will evolve over the course of its 10-week run.\n\"Maybe it's complete silence, maybe we all scream together, maybe we all lie on the floor.\n\"Everything is there, in possibility. We need the public, we need me, and we need chemistry.\"\n512 Hours runs at the Serpentine Gallery in London until 25 August."

      "source": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Italian is picking up the fallen champions after a desperate 2015-16 campaign that saw Jose Mourinho sacked just months after winning the title - and also after some undistinguished early performances this season.\nConte is becoming one of the league's most compelling personalities - so how is he mixing pure theatre in his technical area with the job of pointing Chelsea back in the direction that sees them fighting for the big prizes once more?\nConte's touchline antics stand alongside Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp as a visual spectacle, which means the eye can sometimes be drawn to watching the touchline as much as the action.\nAnd Conte was a blur of perpetual motion again on the Stamford Bridge sidelines in the 2-1 win against Spurs on Saturday - but the top coaches never lose control and the Italian knows there is a time and a place to keep a lid on the emotions.\nConte was involved in a long and heated exchange with fourth official Bobby Madley when an apparent handball by Harry Kane was not spotted in the second half. It ended with an outstretched hand of understanding that was graciously reciprocated by Madley.\nHe was also visibly desperate to inject more urgency into Chelsea as they were outplayed by Spurs for 44 minutes until Pedro's equaliser was the catalyst for a complete momentum shift.\nIt was a drama played out with maximum animation as his voice could be heard above the crowd. And the body language - occasionally leaping up and down on the spot - making him look like he was auditioning for Riverdance.\nThere is, however, substance to back up his frenzied technical area style. Conte's half-time messages, bolstered by the equaliser, were clearly received and understood by Chelsea's players as they carried out his instructions to put pressure on Spurs and play at the higher tempo that suits them.\nHe is transmitting his desire to Chelsea's players, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saying after the Spurs win: \"He's passionate like that every day, every session and that's great for us because it keeps us focused and sharp.\"\nIt has also roused Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea's fans warming to Conte and chanting his name constantly on Saturday night.\nConte's sideshow may be eye-catching but his blood remains cool enough to make the right tactical moves that ensured Chelsea saw out the closing stages of this tight contest in relative comfort.\nConte was keen to stress he wanted his work, and the fact that Chelsea are back on top of the table, to stay low-key and be treated with modesty. \"We must continue to work, improve and we must stay humble,\" said the 47-year-old.\nAnd that is clearly what he intends to do for one of the biggest games of the season when they travel to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City next Saturday lunchtime.\nFor all the emotion on the touchline, Conte is quietly spoken and measured in his press conferences with an increasingly impressive command of English.\nAs Courtois hinted, Conte is obsessive about his work and all the traits he developed in Italy are being brought to bear as Chelsea look unrecognisable from last season.\nConte was known as \"The Hammer\" by some members of the Italian media for the demands on his players, often ringing them at 11pm during his time at Juventus to advise them of changes to training schedules, keeping them on their toes.\nHe even produced a document on players' diet and his exacting standards have not dropped since he took over the office at Chelsea's Cobham training base.\nAs he once said himself: \"There are situations in which you are the hammer and in which you are the anvil. We have to understand the role of the technical staff is of the anvil.\"\nHe also has the miles on the managerial clock to know how to handle every eventuality.\nConte was sacked as coach of Italian Serie B side Arezzo in October 2006, but rehabilitated his career with Bari, Atalanta and Siena before winning three successive Serie A titles with Juventus and taking charge of Italy's national team.\nFormer Italy striker and Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who was captain when Conte was a player at Juve, told BBC Sport during Euro 2016: \"Football is his life and therefore he wears his heart on his sleeve. He doesn't try to be someone else. After the game he is a very pleasant, quiet guy - but during the 90 minutes he wants to win.\"\nAnd winning is something he is becoming very good at with Chelsea.\nChelsea's dressing room is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential in the Premier League. There have been previous accusations of player power - rejected by those inside the dressing room - but it is \"so far so good\" with Conte.\nAnd a testimony to the harmonising effect he has had can be seen with the presence of John Terry on the substitutes' bench.\nThe 35-year-old has been unable to regain his place since injury and a switch to Conte's favoured three-man defensive system left him on the margins.\nTerry accepts his situation is being shaped by successful results and in conversation with former Chelsea team-mate William Gallas, he praised Conte's straight-talking, honest approach and said: \"If I don't get back in the team it means Chelsea are winning and at the minute we are not conceding goals. It possibly means we are going to win the league and if that's with me or without me that doesn't matter.\"\nConte trusts his players, which is evident from the improvement in forward Pedro and fellow striker Victor Moses after loan spells at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham. He has flicked the switch with forward Eden Hazard but has decided midfielder Cesc Fabregas is someone he can currently do without.\nAnd what of the warhorse Diego Costa? He is also a beneficiary of Conte's methods.\nHe wanted the infamously combustible striker to keep his cool after a couple of red card near-misses at the start of the season. While Costa will never be a peaceful presence on the pitch he has clearly listened, taking two heavy bangs early on against Spurs but not retaliating in the manner of old.\nCosta certainly knows who is boss after his demand to be substituted during the 3-0 win against Leicester City to avoid a yellow card and possible suspension for the game against Manchester United was studiously ignored.\nOf course all is usually sweetness and light when victories are coming easily, but Conte is determined to do it his way at Chelsea or not at all.\nConte's watershed moment appeared to arrive very early at Stamford Bridge after miserable performances in the 2-1 home defeat to Liverpool and a 3-0 loss at Arsenal in late September.\nAfter that Arsenal defeat, Conte trusted his tactical instincts and reverted to three at the back with David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta. He used  Andrea Barzagli, Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci in similar roles for Juventus and Italy.\nThe result? Seven successive Premier League wins and only one goal conceded since the day Chelsea lost at Arsenal and sat in 10th place, eight points behind then-leaders Manchester City, who they now lead by one point going into next week's meeting.\nIronically, since the Arsenal game they have had less percentage possession - 52.79% against 56.88% - than they had in the matches before. Chelsea have also had fewer shots, an average of 16.7 up to the Arsenal game compared with 15.4 after, but they have become a much more efficient machine.\nThe manner in which Liverpool pressed Chelsea into submission, and the way Arsenal cut them open with three first-half goals clearly left Conte with food for thought.\nThe results since have proved Conte is determined to learn the ways of the Premier League and take decisive action. Chelsea's place at the Premier League summit is the reward."

Those are our values.\"\nDonald Trump's lawyers did not make their case. In fact, according to three Ninth Circuit judges, they didn't even really try to make their case. Rather than explaining why the temporary travel ban was needed, the administration argued that the president's authority on immigration was so sweeping that they didn't have to explain why the order was necessary.\nAccording to the court, the government was unable to say why Mr Trump's ban addressed a pressing national security threat that a temporary stay of the order would worsen. The lawyers for the challenging states, on the other hand, convinced the judges that re-imposing the order at this point would create further chaos by infringing on the due process rights of those on US soil, regardless of their immigration status.\nBy issuing a unanimous, unsigned opinion, the judges avoid accusations of partisan bias, as one of the three was a Republican appointee.\nMr Trump tweeted a sharp \"SEE YOU IN COURT\" following the decision - but which court?\nAn appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely, although a better move for the president may be to fight in the lower court until Judge Neil Gorsuch joins a conservative majority on the bench.\nThe executive order, at the end of Mr Trump's first week in office, had sparked protests and confusion as people were stopped at US borders.\nThen a week later, a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that stopped the ban in its tracks, after Washington state and Minnesota sued.\nThe Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which heard oral arguments this week.\nLawyers representing the US government argued that the ban was a \"lawful exercise\" of presidential authority.\nBut the two US states said the ban had harmed universities in their states and discriminated against Muslims.\nThe appeal judges did not rule on the constitutionality or the merits of the law, just on the question of its reinstatement.\nThe lower court in Seattle must still debate its merits and there are other legal challenges across the country."

      "source": "The New York businessman-turned-politician said many controversial things and flip-flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign.\nHere, we look back at 24 of his professed beliefs.\n1. The US should use waterboarding\nThis and other methods of \"strong interrogation\" should be deployed in its fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are \"peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he said in June of the banned practice.\n2. Mexico should pay for the \"great, great wall\"\nMr Trump has said he wants to start building the much-touted wall on the shared border from the first day of his presidency, and that Mexico will pay for it. In some of his earliest campaign comments, he suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and \"rapists\".  BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $2.2bn and $13bn.\n3. Muslims should not be admitted to the US\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\".\nHe's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\".\n4. Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11\nDonald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim.\n5. Obamacare is a \"disaster\".\nMr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks.\n6. Climate change is just \"weather\"\nWhile Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\"\n7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power\nMr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists.\n8. Illegal migrants should be deported\nTrump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation.\n9. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\"\nHe says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees.\n10. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\"\nHe has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him.\n11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone\nTrump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate.\n12. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\"\nMr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class.\n13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues\nHe has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking.\n14. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\"\nMr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers.\n15. He's worth $10bn\nBased on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn.\n16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul\nMr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans.\n17. Lobbyists should be more restricted\nMr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.\n18. He is a \"really nice guy\"\nIn Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post.\n19. He could not have groped an unattractive woman\nA video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\"\n20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals\nHe has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\".\n21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\"\nWhy? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance.\n22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions\nOr should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead.\n23. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\"\nHe called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him.\n24. The federal minimum wage should be raised\nWorkers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox."

This is a global problem which requires a global solution to remove current over-capacity and time is a luxury we don't have.\"\nHe called on China to take the same radical action that European steel producers had embraced.\nEarlier, China's official news agency said that blaming the country for the global steel industry's problems was a \"lame and lazy excuse for protectionism\".\nXinhua said in an English-language commentary piece: \"Blaming other countries is always an easy, sure-fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic woes, but finger-pointing and protectionism are counter-productive. The last thing the world needs is a trade war over this issue. Far more jobs will be lost than gained if protectionism prevails.\"\nEU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem told the meeting the steel crisis was \"now life or death for many companies\", but that tariffs were \"only a short-term bandage\", adding: \"Healing the sector's wounds requires sustained international cooperation leading to effective reform.\"\nThe internal market and industry commissioner, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said the European Union should consider allowing member nations to subsidise their steel industries.\n\"We have to discuss whether we can't be more flexible in our judgment of state aid,\" she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \"We cannot push this industry any further.\"\n63.7bn\ntonnes in 2015\n67.5% used in 2015\n70.9% used in 2014\nThe steel crisis has put thousands of UK jobs under threat at plants including Port Talbot in south Wales.\nTata Steel said last month that it was selling its unprofitable UK plants. The company has blamed factors including high energy costs and China \"dumping\" steel on the global market.\nBritain's steel industry: What's going wrong?\nRoy Rickhuss, leader of the Community union, said the meeting was more concerned with the long term, rather than immediate action to save the UK industry.\n\"Today's meeting seemed to be all about long-term challenges. While these issues do need addressing, what we need is urgent short-term action from governments across Europe and beyond to get us through the current crisis and create a sustainable future for steel.\"\nThe Government has come under pressure to rescue Port Talbot and has been urged to consider part-nationalising the industry.\nMr Javid said parties interested in Tata's UK assets had started to come forward: \"It's too early to say much about them at this stage but the important thing is, as we said all along, we will do everything we can to help with that sales process. The steel workers of Britain deserve nothing less.\"\nThe business secretary said that EY had been appointed to act as financial advisers on behalf of the Government, which was \"committed to doing all it can to ensure a sustainable future for the UK steel industry\".\nTata has also appointed Standard Chartered bank as an additional adviser.\nThe Indian group said on Monday that Bimlendra Jha has been appointed to the new role of chief executive of Tata Steel UK.\nHe is executive chairman of the company's Long Products business in Europe and oversaw the sale of plants in Scunthorpe and Teesside to Greybull Capital earlier this month."

They married in 1982.\nAs well as his starring role in Colditz - which centred around the inmates of the notorious German prisoner-of-war camp - and Raffles, Valentine was also known for playing the character of upper-class thug Toby Meres in the secret agent drama series Callan, starring Edward Woodward.\nThe actor was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, but went to school in London. He began his acting career at the early age of 10 and appeared in several BBC children's TV shows, including an adaptation of the classic Billy Bunter stories.\nHe worked pretty much continuously from the 1950s and had roles in TV dramas throughout the decades, including Lovejoy, New Tricks, The Detectives, Heartbeat, Casualty and Coronation Street.\nHis last TV role was as a voice actor for the animated series Chuggington: Badge Quest in 2011.\nValentine was also a regular face on the West End stage, most notably in Hans Anderson at the London Palladium and, more recently, Art at the Wyndhams theatre."

And it was this idea of being an action hero - I just loved it.\n\"I want to be an action hero forever more.\"\nOne of her main sparring partners was Sam Riley, who plays Colonel Darcy, with their verbal battles as imagined by Austen made rather more physical.\n\"When I was hitting Sam, I would get a bit carried away,\" James confessed. \"He was really gentlemanly, and wouldn't tell me until after.\n\"But I was really going for him a bit hard, so he was pretty bruised. You get caught up in the heat of the moment and the adrenalin. You forget you're actually not meant to punch them for real.\"\nShe says she was more inspired by films like The Terminator when preparing for the role, rather than re-watching famous adaptations of Pride and Prejudice.\n\"I needed Liz Bennet to feel quite tough,\" explained James. \"So I watched Linda Hamilton in The Terminator and Angelina Jolie and tried to channel their strength.\"\nShe also watched YouTube clips, forwarded to her by her trainer, to see the \"grace, skill and accuracy\" needed in martial arts.\nPutting this spin on the story brings Liz Bennet, as she prefers to call her, up to date and makes the story \"more modern\", said James.\n\"She's breaking the mould, she's not giving in to that structure in life. She's already such an independent, fierce character, and in this version even more so, because she's a fighter - so it's total girl power, total strength.\"\nAustralian actress Bella Heathcote, who plays \"sensible\" older sister Jane, agreed it was \"great\" that the Bennet sisters are the ones who save the day in the new film.\n\"It's pretty rare for one woman to be the heroine, let alone five of us,\" she said, adding that while \"everyone said it could have been horrible having five girls all together\", there was no cattiness within the group.\nShe insisted Jane is \"still the nice girl\" in this version, \"but she gets to kick ass and kill a few zombies\".\nSeth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies novel was on the New York Times bestseller list for more than 41 weeks.\nThis film adaptation had been planned since 2009 but there were delays due to changes in the cast and crew, including the role of Elizabeth, which was originally lined up for Natalie Portman - now producer of the film.\nSome Austen fans may not appreciate their beloved romance being infiltrated by brain-guzzling zombies, but James said the point of the film was to reach out to people who may not otherwise \"engage with the classic\".\n\"I think we've taken Pride and Prejudice and handled it with absolute love and care,\" she said. \"We're all huge fans of Jane Austen and we've been incredibly sensitive and the story is the heart of the movie still. The characters and the action is propelled by the brilliant plot.\"\nHeathcote agreed that classics are there for the taking when it comes to bringing them up to date for a modern audience.\n\"I feel like people shouldn't be precious with them,\" she said. \"They're not precious with Shakespeare - they do all kinds of interpretations and settings.\n\"So why not do it with all the classics? Because otherwise, they're going to be dated and going to be forgotten.\"\nAnd what would Austen herself have thought? \"I think she'd have loved it,\" said James, adding that the author \"had a great sense of humour\".\nMuch of the humour in the film comes from Parson Collins, played by Doctor Who star Matt Smith - who is James's partner.\n\"He just improvised and made everything up,\" she said. \"I was laughing so much, he was so funny.\"\nThe end of the film hints at a sequel - and James and Heathcote both said they would love that to happen - but critics have not been entirely convinced.\nMark Kermode wrote in the Observer that the mash-up \"lacks bite\", the Financial Times said \"the title is the funniest thing\", Variety thought it \"awkward and unsatisfying\", and Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian said it \"seems like it's just laughing at Austen\".\nBut the Radio Times described it as \"perversely clever\", saying it \"works like a charm\", and Geoffrey Macnab in the Independent gave it four stars, saying it was \"energetic and occasionally inspired\".\nJames is currently in the US, filming Baby Driver, in which she plays an American diner waitress.\nBut perhaps she shouldn't stop the Shaolin martial arts moves training just yet - after all, there's still Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters ready to be adapted.\nPride and Prejudice and Zombies is in UK cinemas now."

We go and do tests in our parks to gauge the reaction and try and understand what kids find entertaining about these things. Our ability to build these characters at a fidelity that looks like the films is really growing.\u201d\nWhen these technologies are fully deployed in Disney parks, and perhaps as toys, Mr Snoddy said Disney will do everything it can to hide the inner technological workings.\n\"Every new technology that\u2019s come along for the last 60, 70 years we have adopted and co-opted and made it into a story telling medium,\u201d he said.\n\"This won\u2019t be different.

It looks like it could be more like six or seven months, March or April 2017, before we hear anything.\"\nHe added: \"The Supreme Court agreed with us that the intrusive sharing of private information which was at the heart of the Named Person scheme was unlawful.\n\"The court granted our appeal, and ordered the Scottish government to pay all our costs. It was a total defeat for the Scottish government.\n\"The substantial delay in announcing their plans to try to navigate a way around the ruling indicates that reality is finally beginning to bite.\"\nAfter the legal challenge, Mr Swinney was forced to act to halt the roll-out of the named person scheme, which has already been trialled in some parts of Scotland.\nIt had been due to be introduced across the country on August 31 2016, but Mr Swinney said he hoped the named person policy can now come into force a year on from that.\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The engagement involved more than 50 meetings with some 250 organisations and groups - and included around 700 young people, parents/carers, practitioners and professionals.\n\"This included leaders from health, education, local authorities, police, faith communities, charities, unions and professional bodies.\n\"The deputy first minister will update parliament in due course.\""

The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, said: \"We are deeply disappointed in the conviction of Navalny and the apparent political motivations in this trial.\"\nA spokesperson for the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the embezzlement charges were unsubstantiated, and that Navalny's jailing posed \"serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia\".\nFrench foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot added his concern, but said: \"We note that not all judicial remedies have been exhausted and that the sentence could be reviewed on appeal.\"\nNavalny's supporters in Moscow have vowed to stage protests against the verdict later on Thursday.\n'Almost inevitable'\nNavalny arrived at the courtroom in Kirov to hear the verdict after a 12-hour overnight train journey from Moscow.\nOur correspondent said Navalny smiled in a resigned manner when the almost inevitable guilty verdict came.\nHis wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband knew he would get a non-suspended sentence and was mentally prepared to go to prison.\nNavalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m rubles ($500,000; \u00c2\u00a3330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh.\nThe prosecution had asked for a six-year jail sentence, but judge Sergei Blinov decided on five years, and said there were no extenuating circumstances that would warrant keeping Navalny out of prison.\nNavalny's co-accused, Pyotr Ofitserov, was also found guilty, and given a four-year jail sentence.\n\"Navalny... committed a grave crime,\" said Judge Blinov as he delivered the sentence.\nState television has only shown limited interest in the process despite Navalny's prominence, but online the trial has been followed extensively.\nMr Navalny came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin in December 2011.\nProfile: Alexei Navalny\nA thorn in Putin's side\nJudge Blinov said he found the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Vyacheslav Opalev, to be \"trustworthy and consistent''.\nNavalny insists that Mr Opalev spoke against him out of revenge, because Navalny had recommended he be fired and his company investigated for corruption.\nAfter the verdict, Navalny tweeted: \"So that's it. Don't get bored without me. Most importantly, don't sit around doing nothing. The toad won't get off the oil pipe by itself.\"\nIn his LiveJournal blog on Wednesday Navalny said: \"The current authorities are not a big, healthy fish, but rather a bloated fish or Latin American toad, which puffs itself up when it sees danger, with the help of television.\"\nIn an unusual step, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live online.\nHe is now one of the key figures of the opposition - a thorn in the side of the political establishment, campaigning against the endemic corruption, our correspondent says.\nMr Navalny has also coined a phrase to describe the ruling party United Russia that has stuck in everyone's minds - \"the party of crooks and thieves\"."

I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually.\nOn top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself.\nThe influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power.\nIn relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for \u00a31m, why would there be another \u00a31m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football.\nJonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group\nAgents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one.\nPeople get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter.\nHowever, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football.\nWe get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly.\nStoke City chairman Peter Coates\nFootball clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised.\nI wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get.\nThere are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market. They play the field, which they're entitled to, and it's not easy."

Such twins usually die before birth.\nThe abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.\nIs it unusual to live so long with the twin?\nOne widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing.\nIn villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman.\nThe abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on."

      "source": "He is the latest casualty of the Trump White House, and takes the record for the shortest term in a top job: he was fired 10 days after being announced as communications director.\nBut of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump.\nHere's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with \"The Mooch\".\nThe brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews.\nAlthough he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines.\nHe appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him.\nMr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine.\nWhy was he sacked?\nAlthough he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly.\nMr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus.\nThe White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were \"inappropriate\".\nTime in post?\nTen days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.)\nThe former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority.\nHe grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles.\nMr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president.\nWhy was he sacked?\nPresident Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak.\nThe announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate.\nTime in post?\nSix months.\nMr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration.\nOver the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live.\nWhy did he leave?\nUnlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president.\nHe stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen\".\nSarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings.\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had \"vehemently\" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a \"major mistake\".\nTime in post?\nSix months.\nMr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.\nHe was criticised first by Democrats for the timing and alleged indiscretion of the announcement, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. But Mr Trump praised the FBI director heavily, saying it \"took a lot of guts\" to make his announcement and that he had \"brought back his reputation\". He blew Mr Comey a kiss at the White House.\nThe president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nWhy was he sacked?\nThe Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation.\nHowever Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a \"showboat\" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking if the \"Russia thing\" when he made the decision to sack him.\nLater it emerged that he allegedly told Russian officials that the dismissal had taken \"great pressure\" off him.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is reported to be investigating whether obstruction of justice occurred.\nTime in post?\nThree years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump.\nTechnically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\nMr Flynn is said to have discussed US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office.\nMr Trump was briefed on the possibility that Mr Flynn was open to blackmail, because Moscow knew he was lying, but 18 days elapsed before the president sacked him, raising questions about exactly what the president knew and when.\nWhy was he sacked?\nIt is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. The question with this sacking was, why did it take so long?\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak.\nTime in post?\n23 days.\nThe president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order.\nWithin hours, she was fired.\nWhy was she sacked?\nA White House statement said Ms Yates had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States\". It also described her as \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration\".\nBut it was also Ms Yates who informed White House counsel that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about his contacts with Ambassador Kislyak and presented a risk of Russian blackmail as a result.\nThe president's sacking of an Obama-era holdover who had openly defied him was certainly less controversial than the Comey dismissal, but it drew heavy criticism from Democrats, who said Ms Yates had done her job in standing up to the travel ban.\nTime in post?\n10 days.\nIt is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on.\nMr Bharara had built a reputation as the \"Sheriff of Wall Street\" after a number of aggressive prosecutions of traders.\nAt the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including an investigation into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign finances and allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News.\nWhy was he sacked?\nMr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard.\nBut there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. A few days before he was sacked, three ethics groups called on Mr Bharara in an open letter to investigate whether Trump companies in his jurisdiction had received foreign payments.\nMeanwhile, a ProPublica investigation revealed that Mr Bharara was overseeing an investigation into stock trades by Mr Trump's incoming health secretary Tom Price.\nThree Democratic senators wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions asking him to investigate the Bharara sacking.\nTime in post?\nSeven years, seven months. Less than two under Mr Trump.\nPaul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair.\nWhy was he sacked?\nThe Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a boilerplate statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US.\nWhile Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives.\nTime in post?\nThree months."
